    "Included in this dataset are many different OKCupid profiles.  Using this data, let's see who can get the highest cross_validated score in predicting male/female based on the features below. Because there are so many features, you may have better luck using SVMs to classify the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Steps:**\n",
    "1. View the data. Think about some of the features that might be relevant. \n",
    "2. Start simple!! Use only one or two features first, and then work your way up.\n",
    "3. Score your classifier using 10 fold cross validation (Try using KFold or StratifiedKFold to ensure shuffling of the data)\n",
    "4. Report your score, let's make a competition out of this!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Some useful hints:**\n",
    "* Try using `pandas.get_dummies( data ) ` to convert string based features into many dummy features\n",
    "* Remember the distinction between categorical and continuous features\n",
    "* Using CountVectorizors here may be useful (think back to Naive Bayes examples)"
