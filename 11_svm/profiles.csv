or on the computer it's usually outside). i love hiking, fishing,
camping, spending time with friends and family (my family is very
important to me, i visit them as often as possible), amusement
parks, movies (bad ones can be more fun than good ones), and
relaxing with a glass of wine at the end of the day. i love to
laugh, no matter what is going on around me i can always see the

tattoos (no hearts, flowers or butterflies and nothing on the face,
neck or below the elbows), they are my scrapbook and i love them.","working (i love my job), spending time with family and friends. i

favorite author is stephen king. also love: max brooks, clive
barker, charlaine harris, laurell k. hamilton, patricia briggs and
many more.<br />

movies: more horror, sci-fi, thrillers, action, etc. no romantic
comedies. my favorite movies are halloween (both the original and
rob zombie's version, in fact i love all of rob zombie's movies),
harold and maude, the blues brothers, star wars (iv, v &amp; vi),

music: i enjoy a lot of different music: rock, punk, metal,
alternative, celtic rock, no country (except johnny cash) or opera.

molly, the fisticuffs, and rob zombie. i have a very eclectic mix

<br />
<strong>background:</strong><br />
on college, i spent most of my free time working in bioinformatics
labs or as editor/illustrator of the school's comedy paper.<br />
<br />
after college, i took the road less traveled and co-founded one
non-profit org and three companies, two of which failed and the
other two are currently on life support.<br />
<br />
as for side projects, i've designed custom skateboards, illustrated
a humorous diy book published by national lampoon, co-hosted a
craft beer advocacy podcast picked as an apple staff favorite, and
spent a summer learning about the future at singularity
university.<br />
<br />
<strong>personality:</strong><br />
i'm open-minded and very laid back. if you ask any of my friends
they'll describe me as an extrovert but that's only because i've
been fighting my natural inclination to be an introvert all my
life.<br />
<br />
i'm a 21st century renaissance man which is a cute way of saying
i'm often an early adopter and know a bit about a wide range of new
gadgets and new technologies.<br />
<br />
i've been an aquaphile for as long as i can remember which just
means that whether i'm in a pool, in the ocean, or just taking a
long shower, i'm home.<br />
<br />
for those familiar with myers-briggs i test as an entj but often
feel more like an intj, i do hate being inefficient though.<br />
<br />
i'm a futurist and enjoy cogitating on where technology is going
and how we as a species will evolve as a result.<br />
<br />
speaking of 'cogitate,' i like to flex my lexicon and play with
prose (especially on okc). i'm no wordsmith but don't be surprised
if i come off sounding overtly contrived, i'm just having
fun.<br />
<br />
i'm often told by others that i am the last thing they would expect
and i'm never quite sure how to take that.","i strive to be some sort of errant intellectual and artist. i'm
currently working at a company that is sending robots to the moon,
acting as cto of a social media marketing company, consulting on an
advertising gamification company, and illustrating a children's
book. i enjoy staying active with yoga and any sport that involves
a board. i love laughing, traveling and having new experiences in
all forms. i can be really nerdy and spontaneous but generally only
get that way around those to whom i am close.<br />
<br />
my long term goal is to better align my career with my passion for
human computer interaction and game design and i'm always open to
chatting with other developers &amp; designers on the
subject.<br />
<br />
i have been fortunate to live a privileged life and i have this
weird altruistic desire to give back to the world and the ones i
love as much as i have been given. i would love to continue
traveling and creating, living simply but passionately.","finding the humor in anything.<br />

6200,26,average,,socially,never,dropped out of space camp,"i am an extremely sarcastic and occasionally ironic musician,
producer, songwriter, photographer and aspiring audio engineer. i'm
what one might call an ""old soul"" (or so i'm told). i grew up in la
and moved to marin. since then i've been back and forth between the
two many times. music is my life, i know how cliche that sounds but
its true. i'm about to release my first album on which i'm playing
everything and singing. no its not d-bag rock music. i'm into
organic sounds, musicianship, soul, raw talent, emotion, and
honesty in the music i listen to. i don't like music that is
annoyingly catchy, formulaically manufactured, screamy, atonal, or
promoting widespread ignorance. i do however listen to music
ironically (see: journey) i also have a sense of humor about myself
and everything around me. i will joke about almost anything,
sometimes too soon. i'm a people watcher. people are funny, why not
point it out and laugh at it? not in a completely cynical way, but
just because its really entertaining... and they deserve it (see:
sarcasm) i'm an optimist. i believe that you really do create your
reality. i sometimes forget this when things get shitty but it
always works out. i'm emotionally aware/available and will tell you
exactly how i'm feeling in a calm, mature fashion. i hate games and
run around bullshit. i am extremely opinionated, however i'm always
willing to be wrong, actually. i'm honest and i have tact. i don't
have mommy or daddy issues, my parents are pretty cool. at the end
of the day, i'm humble about my talents and my position in life. i
try to enjoy life, it's been pretty good to me so far. i pride
myself in not being a douchebag.","i'm releasing my album, going back to school for audio engineering,
loving life and finding someone to enjoy it with.","i dabble in a lot of things: playing lots of instruments, cooking
delicious food, driving for sport, going with the flow, not caring
about sports, back flips on my trampoline, hearing harmonies,
analyzing music and films, stating my opinion, knowing when not to
state my opinion, reading people, trusting my instincts, throwing
my laundry on the ground when i'm too tired, adoring my cat, people
watching, learning from other people's mistakes, buying music
equipment, and so much more!","my ability to deliver sarcastic remarks with the utmost
seriousness.","right now i only read books that relate to music.<br />
<br />
three perfect movies:<br />
<br />
1. the princess bride<br />
2. hot fuzz<br />
3. the fifth element<br />
<br />
i also went to film school so i have a wide array of what i
appreciate.<br />
<br />
music:<br />
<br />
oh, god where to start. i think i've made it clear what qualities i
search for in my music. i dont feel like copying and pasting that
many bands/artists right now. i listen to a smorgasbord of music.
no techno, no mtv bullshit.<br />
<br />
food:<br />
<br />
love food. indian and thai are my jam. i love any cuisine, eating
it and figuring out how to make it. my friends make fun of me for
knowing a lot about food, but then they ask me to order for them. i
just really know what i do and don't like. i will spend way too
much money on sushi.","besides friends and family:<br />
<br />
1. a guitar or ukulele<br />
2. arawan thai in sausalito<br />
3. offensive yet clever jokes<br />
4. knowing where my phone is<br />
5. coconut water<br />
6. long thinking showers","life, why people are the way they are, why i am the way i am, how
things work, new songs, new instruments i could play for my music
in the future, sketch comedy ideas, how i should be doing more than
i am.","out or in. i don't really care. i like to have adventures if i'm
gonna go out, really make a night of it. i love seeing live music,
i should do it more often. i sort of loathe the club scene; mostly
because of the terrible music, artificial people and ridiculous
prices. if a place plays good music, i'm there if i have someone to
go with. i only go to bars with friends. i'd much rather kill a
bottle of wine looking out on the bay than go to a dive bar (see:
old soul). i'm pretty much down for whatever as long as it doesn't
involve shitty people or terrible music.","sometimes, i like to take medjool dates, stuff them with goat
cheese, wrap them with prosciutto, and broil them until they become
the most delicious things ever. deep down, i'm a gourmet fat kid.","you've made it this far and any of this resonates with you. i'm

exploring lots to do with my new free time.<br />
blessed with good genes, i am healthy, spend little time
'primping', and enjoy staying in shape. i'm independent
(financially and otherwise), energetic, resourceful, curious and
passionate. i pride myself on my ability to read people, and have
pretty good common sense. not looking for someone to 'take care of
me', but for the right person to 'care for me', and have good fun
with.<br />
<br />
i've lived in san francisco since 1971, previously lived in north
carolina, new england and mexico city.<br />
i've traveled a fair amount, and plan to do much more.<br />
family and traditions are important to me. i like to entertain
(cooking) and enjoy lively philosophical (or not) and humorous
conversations - exchanging thoughts and ideas w/ friends over good
food and good wine.<br />
<br />
music and the arts (particularly dance) are important parts of my
life. i straddle very different worlds and am equally at ease with
the the 'very well to do', as i am w/ the at risk families that i
work with.<br />
<br />
i genuinely enjoy the company of interesting men and hope to find a
gentleman to share life's adventures with.<br />
<br />
someone who makes me laugh and can laugh at himself.<br />
someone who's intelligent, ambitious and successful (in a broad
sense of the word) but not boastful.<br />
someone who is spirited, with a sense of humor, adventure, and
kindness of heart.<br />
someone with whom i can engage in interesting and stimulating
conversations.<br />
someone who is passionate and appreciates passion.<br />
someone who is honest and can express his feelings.<br />
and....someone who can put up with me and my associated
'imperfections'<br />
<br />
i'm not in a particular hurry to jump into things, but if the
chemistry is right, then we're in luck. at this point in life, i
think two people can tell rather quickly whether there's a
'connection' or not. i don't believe in trying to force something
if there isn't enough of a foundation or chemistry, but i'm willing
to give it a go.<br />

14199,26,,,socially,,graduated from college/university,"i just moved to san francisco from new york city for a new job. i'm
looking to make new friends, explore this great city, and hopefully
meet a great guy that i can connect with on many levels. i'm a
traveler at heart. i love exploring, being adventurous, and
navigating my way through new situations. one of my favorite things
to do is dance! if you like to dance, we will get along. i'm
definitely a people person. i interact with lots of different
people everyday for my job so i'm very friendly. i can be outgoing
and crazy in the right situations if i feel comfortable in my
environment, but usually come off initially as sweet and kind. it
takes time and a certain comfort level for me to show my silly
side, and i do get silly :) i like to be upfront and honest with
people and i expect the same in return. i'm hoping to meet someone
with similar interests, values, and who is looking for something
genuine and real.","flying high in the sky and loving every minute of it! i'm a flight
attendant for the best airline in the country :)","well, i love to dance and i'd say i'm pretty good at it. i'm a
creative, artsy person. i'm a good photographer and writer. i have
thousands of photos from all of my travels, but don't worry i'm not
the kind of person that makes people sit and look at all of them
after i get home from a trip! i'm the opposite actually. my mom is
still bugging me about photos i haven't shown her from like 2 years
ago! i'm a good listener and i'm good at giving people rational
advice. i'm also very tidy and organized, and i'd say i'm a pretty
good cook too. i would have to say i'm a good traveler too. some
people can get so worked up and stressed out about traveling, but
i'm pretty calm about everything. i've learned through experience
that some people can be really good friends, but not necessarily
good travel partners. i don't like to deal with people being
annoying or moody or complaining about stupid little things when
i'm traveling with them. so yeah, i'd say i'm a good travel partner
because i'm not moody, and really just the opposite very grateful
for all my travel experiences and i'm a good map reader :)","hmmm, probably how short i am. short and cute! (and sexy when i
want to be)","books: the giver, a fine balance (amazing work of historical
fiction set in india), i like humorous nonfiction like pretty much
anything by david sedaris and chelsea handler, water for elephants,
the alchemist (anything by paulo coelho actually), and the list
goes on...<br />
<br />
movies: a walk on the moon, brokedown palace, anchorman, labyrinth,
west side story, the great debaters, the other sister, only you,
pretty much any stupid silly comedy<br />
<br />
shows: seinfeld, friends, sex and the city, entourage, ellen, the
price is right (i actually saw bob barker on the red carpet the
last season he was on air and my friend called out 'i love you' to
him and he looked right at her and said, 'i love you too' haha),
grey's anatomy, unites states of tara, i just started watching new
girl and it's pretty hilarious<br />
<br />
music: i'm pretty open to music, it really depends on what kind of
mood i'm in. i like hip hop, reggaeton, and more upbeat music when
i'm out and dancing, and i listen to more chill, mellow stuff when
i'm home chillin out. i like to listen to spanish music while i'm
cooking. some favorite artists: lauren hill, dispatch, matisyahu,
all the marleys (bob of course, ziggy, damien, and stephen),
mattafix, lebanese blonde, incubus, citizen's cope, manu chao, amy
winehouse, beyonce, the beatles<br />
<br />
food: i love all types. my favorite types would be moroccan and
greek. they have a few amazing moroccan restaurants in philly that
i've been to and inspired me to try and cook similar dishes. i love
fruit, especially in the summertime. one of my favorite snacks of
all time is an apple with peanut butter.","family and friends, water, sun, airplanes, hugs, and entertainment",how i can better myself and the world around me.,"meeting up with friends for a drink or 2 when i'm in the city. if

who is affectionate and isn't afraid to say what's on his mind. and
to be completely honest right now, don't message me if you're just
trying to meet women to have sex with. i'm looking for more than
that. i think the best relationships come out of friendships, so i
would want to take things fairly slow at first, see if we like each
other as people before choosing to be romantic or sexual with each
other. i think it's important to establish that we are attracted to
each other and have chemistry before jumping into anything too
soon.<br />
<br />
i'm looking for a guy who is stable, well-educated, and has a good
head on his shoulders, but has a fun, spontaneous side to him as
well. i want a guy who knows how to respect women. if you are
assertive, but not too aggressive then it shows me that you know
what you want but you don't push things if it's not working
out.<br />
<br />
i'm physically attracted to guys who are on the shorter side. i'd

important to work in a career field you love rather than be stuck
doing something you hate, regardless of the income it provides. as
long as i have a roof over my head, and enough income to pay for
normal living expenses and some fun money, i'm pretty content. i
don't let materialistic gains and wants get to my head. i would
rather take less salary-wise at a job i love and have peace of mind
and look forward to work everyday, rather than the alternative. i
have worked in myriad career fields, ranging from retail clothing
stores in the mall to the adult entertainment industry (no i've
never done porn but ive been offered to) to auto body and mechanic
jobs. you only live once so i take it to heart. i enjoy drinking
socially every so often, and i love my city and all of the

live by the golden rule with others (easier said than done) and
just take the time to enjoy the small, meaningful things in life.

paragraphs, but here are some basics:<br />
<br />
i am an ex-new yorker who has lived in the bay area for a long
time. as a health care professional who enjoys my work, and the
mother of two teen-aged sons (one of whom just left for college), i
would say that ""balance"" is a constant goal. my friends would
describe me as fun, energetic, easy-going, compassionate,
politically progressive, honest and direct. i love to travel and am
comfortable camping or indulging in luxury, and anything in
between. i think that point reyes and the east bay regional parks
are two of the bay areas most incredible treasures.<br />
i run, hike, bicycle, take yoga classes. a fun night out could be
anything from a walk in the hills to a romantic dinner to a movie
or cultural event. i am fortunate to have a wonderful ""extended
family"" of friends who are a big part of my life. music is
important to me and i like lots of different types. i speak enough
spanish to get by, am in a monthly book group, also enjoy
photography. i guess i would say that i am ""psychologically
minded,"" sentimental, and quite independent and adventurous.<br />
<br />
i am relatively new to this internet dating scene and feel a bit
like a ""lost teenager,"" but hopefully with the wisdom and integrity
that being a bit older brings...","enjoying it and appreciating it.<br />
<br />
now that my sons are getting older, i have more time to explore
personal interests, new relationships, and to have some spontaneity
and fun.","communicating, bringing people together, making people laugh and
staying in touch with old friends",my curly hair and blue eyes,"i love a good novel and enjoy many kinds of movies - often find
myself at foreign and independent films, and enjoy many dramas,
romantic comedies and documentaries.<br />
i used to be a rock n'roll groupie but like many kinds of
music.<br />
i really appreciate the diversity of ethnic food available in the
bay area and enjoy exploring all types of restaurants.","friends, family, travel, books, chocolate, the beach","my family and friends, the state of the world and politics, my
interesting and somewhat demanding work, where my next adventure
will be, the next chapter of my life after my kids leave home.","any of the following:<br />

sub-freezing temperatures because gosh darn it that's how we did
things back east. it totally sucked, but suffer any abuse long
enough and you either learn to love it or die. so now i'm stuck in
a life-long dysfunctional love affair with snow.<br />
<br />
my high-school graduating class numbered under 10.<br />
<br />
i moved out west because not much changes culturally where i'm
from, at least not per generation. the bay area sounded like a good
venue.<br />
<br />
i'm verbose, but only in print. in person i'm quite the laconic
chap.<br />
<br />
i hate text messaging, and the ensuing flaky behavior it causes,
but no one else does it seems. oh for the days when people made
plans 3 months in advance and had to stick to it since that was the
quickest possible correspondence.<br />

which i helped build so aside from having some serious pride there
is also literally my blood (nail-gun), sweat and tears
(...nail-gun) in the place.<br />

them, otherwise just something myself. (b) <a class=""ilink"" href=

distinct risk of pneumonia. (d) trumps all other options.","being presented with a problem in a medium i'm unfamiliar with, and
somehow solving it with all my limbs intact.<br />

i'm also really good at not eating brussels sprouts.",lack of shaving in the mutton chop region.,"things i like to read: epic multi-volume fantasy tales. sardonic
narratives of elder times are also good. tobacco road and the
virginian are good examples. some sci-fi mixes in there too, like
neal stephenson's stuff. comic books, powers is a great
contemporary story.<br />

exception it is always delicious.","1. trees<br />

to constantly learn and experience new things, but i don't have

love to travel as often as possible (which isn't as often as i'd
like), but i have a home. i love to eat great food, but i'm not in
need of a diet.<br />

essentially, i'm a pretty balanced guy who feels that doing the
exact same things over and over makes jack a dull boy. not that
some routine in life doesn't save sanity.<br />

so, why have you come here, good sir (one might ask)? well,
probably like you, i'm looking to meet cool guys. with that in
mind, here's what i'm ultimately looking for (but am enjoying
exploring options in the meantime):<br />
<br />
first, and foremost, i want a best friend and partner in crime.
someone i can laugh with (humor is important to me), someone who i
can lean on and someone who can lean on me. i do not want it to be
an all consuming situation (where neither of us have no other
friends...i have good friends and i like them), but i want my
partner to be the person i'd choose to hang out with a majority of
the time if given the choice.<br />
<br />
i want someone who is strong (not specifically physically, though
that is nice), smart and independent in their own right.<br />
<br />
i want someone who is interested in doing and seeing new things and
places; i don't want someone who just wants to sit around the house
all the time. don't get me wrong, sitting around the house can be
great (and sometimes needed), but not as a habit.<br />
<br />
i want someone who i'm physically attracted to and who is
physically attracted to me. i'd like to think we'd both try to pick
each other up at a party we were both attending if we didn't
already know each other.<br />
<br />
now comes in sex. while sex is quite important to me, it is
meaningless to have it in a relationship without the items listed
above. i can have hot sex with a person but don't want them as
anything more than friends unless the other stuff is there.<br />

born and raised in sweden, lived in france and geneva for a year -
returned and thought i would never leave my street again...
happened to see a job ad for san diego that i really liked, and 3
weeks later i took off (sept 11, 2001) with the intention to stay
for 4 months. max 9. here we are more than 10 years later...<br />

have involved myself in a number of different things and
associations, explored different areas, personal growth (leadership
training, coaching), singing, dancing, yoga...<br />

loving california - san francisco more than san diego - and aimed,
by resigning from my job - to create a lifestyle where i could
spend more time and work from sweden, and spend time with my
family, without moving back.<br />
<br />
started a business doing what i love doing, making voices heard for
positive change through social media. so grateful for the
flexibility it gives. can still be long hours - but i can decide
when, where, for/with whom. life outside the cubicle is quite
fantastic. and leaving 8 years in finance wasn't wrong
either.<br />

i have an optimistic, fun-loving, curious nature. things that pique
my interest include both 'fun' and 'fine' dining, concerts, travel,
and sensual exploration. i'm really easy going in that i know what
i like, i know who i am, i show up, and part of my joy is finding
connection in conscious pursuits.<br />

i am passionate about health and healing on all levels -
body/mind/spirit. i strive for harmony and balance in my life and
relationships. i enjoy music, dancing, art (appreciation), being in
nature, traveling. i am affectionate and sensual.<br />
<br />
i meditate and exercise daily and take good care of my body, mind
and spirit. i have a strong spiritual streak (not attached to any
specific religion and allowing of all) which is thankfully tempered
with a healthy sense of humor. after all, lightening up is a huge
part of becoming enlightened :)<br />

me.","being present and enjoying the journey. doing what i can to bring

to party and just live live to the fullest. i live my life to seize
the day because its not worth it dwelling on what we could have or
should have done and life will just pass you by if you over worry
about the future. i am a psychology student who aspires to one day
be a clinical psychologist, so i find people pretty interesting,
entertaining more so. i love learning about new things, art,
culture, science, religion, philosophy. i love to just spend time
with my friends and family and have fun! i am also pretty artsy in
that i love photography and music, i work as a makeup artist and a
bartender, so i love being creative taking pictures, doing crazy
colorful make-up looks and fun new drinks. i am honest and
trustworthy, i love my family and friends and would do anything for
them. i am also a crazy party animal and a social butterfly. i love
to party and have a good time and most importantly, i love to
laugh. i am sarcastic and witty and sometimes kind of a smart ass,
but its all in good fun. the best day is a day at the park with a
12 pack of pbr, a burrito, a blunt, and good times with good
conversations with great friends. life is what you make it, and i
choose to live mine surrounded by good people with good energy to
have the best of times.","i am a student, a makeup artist, and a bartender. i am working

shootin' the shit, its fun. i really enjoy photography, i love
taking adventures places and taking a photo diary of what i see and
who i am with, i would like to think i am good at it too, haha. i
love makeup and i love to make someone feel good about themselves.
i am also really good at making people laugh, i am a sarcastic
chick that just calls it as it is.","my energy, i have been told it is positive and infectious.<br />

i love music, all kinds. the majority of the music i listen to is

34801,33,fit,mostly anything,socially,never,graduated from college/university,"i'm an introverted person, but that doesn't mean i'm shy (maybe
just a little in the beginning of getting to know someone). it just
means that i'm energized by the internal world of ideas,
impressions and emotions. hence, i'm a sensitive and creative
person whose greatest form of self-expression is through
writing.<br />
<br />
however, being introverted has been a challenge for me. i
constantly have to battle the natural propensity of being in my own
little world and meet the challenge of stepping out and attuning to
other people. i have not always been used to letting other people
in nor looking to others to have my needs met. it's a bit humbling
to admit this, but ironically at the same time this has also
drained me from vitality. the line between introversion and lonely
loner has definitely gotten blurry and basically no man is an
island.<br />
<br />
anais nin once said, ""we don't see things as they are, we see
things as we are."" well, i've finally reached the point where i'm
tired of seeing the world from my sole perspective. i would like to
begin sharing my life and experiencing it with people who may
become potential friends or more. therefore, change, growth and
renewal are my goals.<br />
<br />
once i begin to open up i am a hopeless romantic, sweet, and
affectionate with an enthusiastic, winsome, childlike approach to
life. i have a good simple heart with good intentions. i'm also a
very caring friend, patient, listen deeply, offer encouragement,
enthusiasm and support. i am also passionate, but my greatest
passion in life is film and consider myself to be an absolutely
zany cinephile. why? in essence what it all comes down to is the
love of story. movies provide us with fresh insights into human
nature, society and characters that feel more real than people
sometimes. so many things can resonate in a single film - truth,
love, humor - but deep down movies can sometimes present us with
truths that need to be questioned or lead us to empathize with
suffering souls or people under extreme pressure and to crawl into
their skin and see the world through their eyes and how they
overcome adversity or spiral out of control. i could go on and on
about my love for film, but i only have a limited space.<br />
<br />
other than my passion for film i also enjoy dancing, museums,
taking long walks, good conversation and connecting with people on
deep levels.<br />

afraid of expressing themselves.","i work as an editor for a private company in sunnyvale. i love to

i think the best way to summarize myself right now is to describe a
moment in my life i experienced recently. i was walking up the hill
to alamo sq park from my new apartment. it's this beautiful park at
the very top of a hill, surrounded by beautiful victorians, with a
view of much of the city. big, windswept cypress <a class=""ilink""
href=""/interests?i=trees"">trees</a> grow there, and there's a shoe
garden and a place for dogs to play. there was this moment, at
almost 6pm, when the sun was just thinking about setting for the
evening, and the fog was meandering in over the sunset, and a
mission bell was ringing in the distance, where the wind caught my
hair and i felt like i was exactly where i should be, in that
moment. that i finally understood san francisco and what it has to
offer me.<br />
<br />
i am a sophisticated, playful, intuitive woman who knows what she
wants, and isn't afraid to ask for it. i'm glad i waited to think
about getting married and having kids until i got to know who i am
and what i want in a partner.<br />
<br />
people talk to me everywhere i go. i think it's because i have a
friendly face and an open energy. i like it because i get to hear
stories and collect them for future use. i love weird people,
characters, tricksters and fools. i see coyote everywhere and he
reminds me to laugh at myself above all else.<br />
<br />
disclaimer 1: i don't usually respond to chat messages because a
few idiots have ruined it for the rest of you by being nasty. i'd
like to at least have one or two email conversations first before
chatting, but i'd be happy to chat after that.<br />
<br />
disclaimer 2: i'm a little weird around the edges. i'm kind of an
urban witch, i have a cauldron and an altar, i sometimes howl at
the moon, but i'm also super modern and practical. i like computers
and high heels and hiking and meteor showers. i like shoe polish
and i also like mud and i like my men that way too.<br />
<br />
disclaimer 3: i'm kind of an old soul who has learned how live in
the now and be more childlike. i'm super playful, but i've got some
deep, dark depths where i hide a lot of wisdom. i'm looking for
someone who is evolved in those ways too, i don't want to teach
anyone. i want to keep learning with someone.","i moved to san francisco two years ago from boston. i'm working for

biographies as long as they're about amusing people. i'm also
always reading several books about shamanic healing. my family

<br />
food: right. i like food. all food really. i'm not eating mammals
(delicious, tasty mammals) much right now because i have this idea
that i'd rather not eat things i wouldn't be capable of killing
with my bare hands. cows and sheep and pigs, well, they are so
nice! i couldn't really look one in the eye and kill it even though
they are delicious. birds however, are basically dinosaurs and they
would kill you if they could so they are fair game. i am also a big
fan of eating fish because i'm not convinced they even know they're
alive. you can eat whatever you want though, this is just my own
personal rule.","family, friendship, a decent pair of shoes, nearby trees, something
to munch on, a cold beverage","i'll be honest. i think about babies a lot. all of my friends are

friends here in sf. most of the time friday night is casual dinner
and a cocktail with a friend, or maybe an art gallery thing, or a
burlesque show, or a rock concert, or some such. there's always
something fun to do in sf.","i can't stand watching people brush their teeth, especially when
they start talking to me while doing it. i still own my favorite
stuffed animals from my childhood but they live on the shelf not my
bed. i collect antique scissors and small works of art. i hate
overhead lighting. i attract odd people and i have learned to love
that.","you are smart, fun, sexy, a closet nerd, kind-hearted, positive,

thanks for reading. i live in a van that's set-up as an rv by
choice and enjoy a comfortable and stress free life style. no
mortgage or rent and the solution for a noisy neighbor is the turn
of a key away. beyond simplicity, i think what's most appreciated
about living this way is that every day is a little adventure. i
live life both purposefully and spontaneously. i like being
challenged by random events and thinking on my feet.<br />
why would i be a good boy friend? i'm a confident, romantic,
creative, and affectionate man with a good sense of humor. am good
conversation too and dependable. my life is usually a simple one
with simple pleasures and am happy. i never have mood swings or get
depressed and am rarely fearful. i'm open minded and accepting of
people and their choices. who am i searching for? a woman who's
calm and self assured and happy with her life. also pleasantly
out-going, with a good sense of humor, and still interested in
intimacy. i like my life and don't have plans to change it
significantly so am not seeking co-habitation. beautiful women come
in all shapes, sizes, and colors so don't make distinctions. it's
really about mutual chemistry. if it's there and we feel a good
connection then there's a potential. if not, then we continue our
search. i'm healthy, completely std free, am active, and enjoy the
out-doors, travel, and new experiences. if you like what's been
shared i hope you'll take a moment and ask to learn more.
thanks<br />

p.s. friends have recommended concealing or not making mention of
living in a van as it puts women off. i've declined to do that as
feel it would be deceptive though don't mean to over emphasize it.

city for a time, working as a writer for a magazine and an editor
for a literary agency while auditioning, but there was not much
time for the auditioning part unfortunately. i have recently
completed graduate school where i studied psychology to become a
marriage and family therapist, and i am now working at two high
schools and an elementary school as a mental health therapist where
i also use drama therapy techniques, so i can keep a little bit of
my acting side aide :)<br />

i am a person that is an open book. i wear my heart on my sleeve,
to be cliche, but it's true. i do not believe in hiding or
dishonesty. i have, unfortunately, experienced too much of that in
my life. if i learned one thing through my years at the acting
conservatory, i learned that one needs to be himself/herself, play,
explore, and if one is ok with herself, others will follow. those

why don't i start out by saying that i am actually looking for a

after all, i am guy. but that will have to wait. not being a guy,
having sex. you see i have decided that there wont be any more
until i am in a committed relationship. so, if you are the rare
woman looking for a hook-up, i am not your guy. and if you think
commitment is established by date 5, i am still not your guy.

kids: its ok if you have one. but i don't have any desire for

means being aware of my attachment to that fabricated thing i call
me and thereby letting go of all those thoughts that are
continually being fired off by my out of control synapses in my
brain. :) would love to, no, let me re-state that, only want to be
in a relationship where there is an understanding of who we are and
who we are not. if that makes sense to you then nothing more needs

as my name suggests, i love fairy tales (preferably the disnified

not a clubber/smoker/drinker and would prefer to meet others with
similar lifestyle habits. i like my books, tv shows/movies/dramas,
food (not a really picky eater) and i like talking about them. i
enjoy learning (science, languages, piano- teaching myself...). i'm
also trying to be more active: kickboxing, rock climbing, hiking
and biking (leisurely) are fun.<br />
<br />
also, i'm trying new things (like okc) and trying to explore the
world outside the lab i work at. there was a phd comic that showed
scientists being completely oblivious to the zombie apocalypse
occurring outside their building because (a lot of labs) have no
windows. so the point is, the lab i work at barely has any windows
and i'm just trying not be the last to know about any impending
apocalypses...<br />

""/interests?i=kink"">kink</a>, care, compersion. basically i am an

physically, i have discreet and meaningful body ink/<a class=

piercings. i like looking somewhat ""normal"", (define that please!),
but naked be adorned. i have a <a class=""ilink"" href=
""/interests?i=body%2fspirit"">body/spirit</a> that desires intense
sensation: giving and receiving, the latter which i am currently
trying to ameliorate.<br />
<br />
i am <a class=""ilink"" href=

<a class=""ilink"" href=""/interests?i=open+relationships"">open
relationships</a> seeking poly minded, kinky,
comrades/companions/lover - possibly primary if it is that; not a
booty call, (unless exceptionally talented;). to be honest, i'm
still reeling from an abrupt relationship shift in feb '12, so am
not really looking for anything intense - in addition to being
primarily distracted by the housing search, (see above and below:).
c'est la vie...<br />
<br />
mostly, i am eager to meet fellow adventurers, especially sailors,
skydivers, and pilots - particularly if you have the following
criterion: practice and value <a class=""ilink"" href=
""/interests?i=transparency"">transparency</a> in relationships, (if
you don't know what that means, we are probably not suited),
because you know yourself well enough to know that you cannot fully
know yourself at the same time. my preference would be for
someone(s) creative and queer or queer friendly, but i find
chemistry perplexing, dictating ""love"" impossible, longevity
unobvious. besides, we don't need to have chemistry to explore the
diverse culture the bay area has to offer, although connection
makes it more amusing, n'est ce pas?<br />
<br />
having said that, people who can appreciate my extraordinary life,
(as ideally i do theirs), will get further than those who judge or
idolize it foolishly.<br />
<br />
apparently, i am an <a class=""ilink"" href=
""/interests?i=enfp"">enfp</a>, or only 3% of the population, which
makes me special, but a little lonely sometimes, although i have a

i am wonderful, wacky, and wise...","living fully. i am an alternative lifestyles educator who presents
loads of classes on kink and bdsm around the country. a kink

<br />
since recovering from a wrist injury, i run a couple times a week,

started <a class=""ilink"" href=""/interests?i=swimming"">swimming</a>

swim! (a metaphor for my personality at large). i have taken
lessons in chicago but sf begs for more ""water sports"" - of the
oceanic kind;)<br />
<br />
i am learning to sail! i finished my first round of lessons last
year, have sailed as first mate several times in the bay and in
australia and am going out <a class=""ilink"" href=

<br />
for my birthday this year, i jumped out of an airplane at 18,00

<br />
i am also drawn to combined physicality like <a class=""ilink"" href=

trauma/tension release therapy which i am also learning to teach to
others since it has been so beneficial to me. having confessed all
that, i must admit, i'm not at all ""hippie like""...much more urban
with esoteric sophistication.<br />
<br />
i love going to events at <a class=""ilink"" href=

process of making it. i love eating well and don't mind investing

i am unconventional, adventurous, free-spirited, open-minded, and
an intelligent gentleman with a slight bit of bad boy for fun. fred
is not my real name, there is a private joke involved here.
later.<br />
<br />
i was in an amazing marriage for twenty years to a lovely danish
lady, my best friend and soulmate, and we lived in denmark for the
last ten years. she passed away three years ago at age 41. she was
a victim of over-exercise that resulted in a brain aneurysm,
coupled with an overrated danish medical system that failed to
properly diagnose and treat her until it was too late. so we lost
her, leaving me with a big hole in my life, and as an older single
father of a young son. he and i spent the last three years coping,
healing, and trying to figure out what to do next.<br />
<br />
now we are embarking on the next chapter of life. ten years ago
scandinavia was a lovely place. it evolved into a ridiculous
right-wing anti-foreigner atmosphere, and it is just unpleasant to
live there now. even my pre-teen son can see denmark for what it
has become and he wants to grow up as an american, not as a dane. i
bought a business in san francisco, california, usa and we have
come home to california.","after a long and successful international corporate career spanning
several continents i am turning a 45-year-long motorcycle hobby
into my livelihood. i bought a motorcycle dealership. the thought
of retirement simply doesn't appeal to me. maybe i just refuse to
grow up. actually, given this economy i am creating something to
eventually leave to my three sons so they are not at the mercy of
corporate america and our questionable american business cultural
directions. i have gone from high-flying corporate globe-trotter to
simple shop-keeper selling two-wheeled dreams to the public. it is
a riot, a labor of love, and provides a sentimental inner
satisfaction.<br />
<br />
out of necessity my two primary foci are my young son and my new
business. i never expected to be a 60-something single father with
a pre-teen son but here i am, and i am determined to make this go
very well. right now we are working through a european to american
cultural change and he is going to school in a new language. he
needs my help. i have also discovered that the business i bought
has some additional problems lurking under the surface which i need
to resolve. this ceo gig is over-rated. ;-)<br />
<br />
women with children my son's age are much younger than i, most of
them are not attracted to an older man, and women my age don't want
the responsibility of new children. so i am in dating no-man's
land. while i would eventually like to find a new relationship, i
have to be a bit pragmatic about this under the circumstances.
since my wife passed away i have had two relationships that
eventually fizzled, and one of the things i realized is that my son
gets attached to someone new as well. no more introductions to new
women for him until i am sure about things. therefore, this is
going to go slowly.<br />
<br />
back in my university days, i was a poor student who sold two
guitars and a saxophone in the same month in order to buy food and
pay my rent. now it is 30-some years later and i recently started a
guitar collection (i am up to three now.) the music is coming back
more easily than i thought. it gives me peace in life and is my
version of a private spiritual sanctuary.<br />
<br />
guitars notwithstanding, i dance to a different drummer, i always
have, and i do not apologize for it. life is what you make of it -
no excuses, just grab it by the drumsticks and force it in your
desired direction. having faced several life-changing catastrophies
not of my own making that would have driven others to drink or
worse, and having beaten them all, i am still standing, smiling,
giving, and taking life on my terms. bad things do happen to good
people, but they can be beaten back and become nothing but
character-building exercises. if i am wrong and there is a god,
he/she/it and i will have some very long conversations some day,
and he/she/it has a lot of explaining to do. i am looking forward
to that conversation. ;-)<br />
<br />
i am not the easiest guy to categorize, but if you are an
intelligent woman with a vocabulary, a spine, an opinion or two, a
desire to truly connect and communicate with your partner on
multiple levels, a life of your own and a higher than average sex
drive you will not be disappointed. i expect an equal partner who
brings spice to the relationship. if you have a bit of a temper,
even better. i will completely adore you and be your best friend
while keeping you happy and on your toes.","lots of things. work stuff, guy stuff, family stuff, friend stuff,
romance, flirting... sexual foreplay in the 21st century starts
with naughty little text messages early in the day designed to make
love to your mind and keep you subtly and subconsciously mentally
aroused. if i know that you are in an important meeting with the
phone on silent, you are a far too tempting a target for this bad
boy. i will not be able to resist... ;-)<br />

some time by letting you know that i don't have my junk together
right now. if you are the type of person who requires a certain
level of junk togetherness in the people you talk to, now would be
a good time to move on. if i had to quantify exactly how together
my junk is right now, i would say it's probably around 32.5 percent
together. (with an error bar of around 2% junk togetherness in
either direction.)<br />
<br />
using the anderson junk togetherness profile index, which i have
definitely not just made up on the spot to sound more reputable, i
would fall into category c, subcategory q. this translates to
roughly somewhere between having junk together and not having junk
together, but some doubts have been cast on the validity of the
ajtp, so use it at your own disgression.<br />

*cough.*<br />
<br />
okay, specifics. i'm a relatively honest person. when i'm put into
a situation where honesty may be hurtful, i will still generally be
the person who will offer it. to some people this translates to
""i'm an asshole."" i don't necessarily think this is the case, but
ymmv. that said, i do try to be tactful. one individual may loudly
tell you ""you gotta booger son."" in front of a gathering of foreign
delegates, while another person may simply touch their nose
suggestively while looking at the person in question who in this
example has a booger.<br />

both of these people are being honest, but one is being more
tactful.<br />
<br />
moving on, i am vegan, but i eat lots of fast food at the places
where i have made sure i can craft myself an order which suits
this. you might say that the money funds an industry that harms
animals, and that this makes me a bit of a hypocrite. maybe. but if
nobody is buying these vegan/vegetarian options, then the fast food
place isn't going to know there's a demand for it. that and
burritos are delicious. shh.<br />

works of fiction that can compete directly with shakespears, jane
austins, tolkiens, and asimovs.<br />

in my opinion, romance is an exercise of the heart not the brain.
you can wait forever for someone that makes perfect sense to be

so much about your way being the right way. its the attraction that
matters not altogether what its based on. that probably makes me
sound like a totally whimsical person huh? lol.<br />

i'm not saying that having forethought or a plan for relationships
is a bad thing. internet dating seems a lot like
dating-by-checklist. you describe your ideal match and hope they
find you. that's not how i roll cause i don't really have an ideal
match. i believe that trial and error of the heart is a good thing

i'm back in sf after 5 years in the uk for school, an ex-computer
hacker turned archaeologist (by education and inclination, if not
currently occupation.) i read a lot, and i like to wander around
the city and environs. probably my single biggest hobby otherwise
is going to see live music. essentially anything from classical to
bluegrass to punk, but i get to a few shows a month, depending on
who is in town. second biggest hobby.. hmm. does trying to convince
my friends to come out the aforementioned shows count as a hobby?
probably not, huh.<br />
<br />
other stuff... i love to travel, both around the us (roadtrip!) and
elsewhere. i dig museums and used book stores, and cozy coffeeshops
(and/oror blanket-nests) on rainy days, and diners on foggy nights
(or, really, i guess, anytime. i am a big fan of the all-day
breakfast! why is the man always trying to tell me when i can have
my pancakes. breakfast riot!).<br />

so, that songs has been stuck in my head for a while...the kind of
stuck where you don't even realize you're humming it out loud until
someone points it out to you...<br />
<br />
as a homage to that song, instead of those long winded summaries,
i'm going to share the top 5 reasons why i like being short:<br />
<br />
1. when i fly, i always have plenty of leg room.<br />
2. i never really have to worry about low hanging branches or low
doorways.<br />
3. when i go to amusement parks, i am short enough to go on the kid
rides, and tall enough to ride on the ""normal"" rides (more bang for
your buck)<br />
4. most people always assume that short people look younger. i'm
not sure if people assume that about me because of my height or
because i'm asian... either way, it helps when i'm buying a movie
ticket and still using my college id for the discount.<br />
5. my favorite one: during an earthquake, i fit underneath a
desk/table. the whole duck and cover works for me. i always feel
bad for the tall people who have their arms and legs sticking out
when they try to get under.","enjoying life for what it is, traveling, listening to good music,
spending time with people i love... and of course working (i really
enjoy what i do, so most of the time it doesn't really feel like
work)","enjoying life...making a fool of myself...or being able to talk to
just about anyone.","my laugh. i laugh a lot... sometimes to the point of where i'm
crying and my voice disappears...","books: the giving tree, catcher in the rye, the alchemist, kite

42888,47,a little extra,,rarely,never,dropped out of college/university,"i'm a mellow, easy-going person. i'm pretty intelligent and have a
wicked sense of humor so if you can't groan or laugh at a pun,
you're barking up the wrong me :-)<br />
<br />
my playtime activities tend to wax and wane. i'm currently doing a
lot of dancing- west coast swing, 2-step, waltzing, contra at
present. i enjoy photography and shoot models and burlesque &amp;
drag shows. in the past, i've done singing (badly!) painting &amp;
drawing, a little improv. i studied aikido for many years until i
discovered dancing.<br />
<br />
i've worked mainly in techy electronics and it jobs that involve
wearing many hats but usually some form of research or product
development- from bio-tech to satellites. i figure it's like
tinker-toys for big boys. i don't consider myself a geek or nerd. i
see technology as a tool to use, not as something to use me. i'm
not into gaming, fantasy, rpg ect. the real world is interesting
and challenging enough for me!<br />
<br />
i'm a cmt massage therapist and have a practice doing deep tissue
bodywork incorporating my own physical techniques and lighter
energetic modalities like reiki. i've helped a lot of people work
through issues that had been through the gauntlet of other healing
modalities and not received relief.<br />
<br />
i like and enjoy people in general and in social settings. i like a
lot of people a little but only a little of them a lot. i
frequently chat with strangers and people i meet and usually leave
them smiling or laughing- hopefully with me and not at me. i enjoy
doing random acts of kindness for friends and strangers alike.
however, i enjoy the time i spend by myself and need my downtime. i
don't like noise or chaos.<br />
<br />
i identify as queer in orientation, which is to say i don't
identify. people are way too complex and fluid to stick a label to.
i tend to be attracted to people that are in the androgynous middle
or with unusual or creative looks, rather than cookie-cutter macho
studs or pinup models. trans- &amp; ftm-friendly. can't we just be
everybody-friendly?<br />
<br />
i identify as gender-queer. i tend to emotionally and mentally have
a fairly balanced mixture of both genders. i like to be free to
pick and choose and express the best of both worlds and what
matches my persona in the moment.<br />
<br />
i have a lot of social connection in the transmale (ftm) community.
i feel comfortable in that setting as the energy feels like a
better match for me as opposed to a cis-male gay or straight
environment. i find that in general that transguys, though 100%
male, have a more balanced nature that does not drift into the
extremes of macho or femme and thus feels closer to my own way of
being.<br />
<br />
my orientation is queer also. to me, it's about finding which parts
bring pleasure, not what the shape of the parts are. i tend to
prefer simple intimate and sensual physical interactions, i'm fluid
and very empathetic so i tend to be into whatever my partner is
into. if you're the type of person that can laugh while having sex,
then we'll get along just fine.<br />
<br />
i tend to be very flexible and understanding in relationships. i
prefer open and poly but am fine with mono and will honor whatever
we mutually agree to. there are no rules except the ones that we
make ourselves.<br />
<br />
i don't believe in being judgmental or dogmatic. every person is
the way they are for a reason- none is right or wrong or better or
worse for it- so i accept who they are and what they bring to the
relationship.<br />
<br />
my personality type seems to blur somewhere between intj and intp.
my mind is always looking for better and more efficient ways of
doing things, or how to improve on them. it abhors inefficiency and
irrationality. it searches for patterns and reasons and whys behind
what it sees. but behind all this thinking and analyzing is a big
heart that knows that the correct action is not always the logical
one but the most compassionate one.","trying to put more fun into it- dancing, piano, trying to focus
more on now and less on imagined stories of what might be.<br />
trying not to limit my own potential.<br />
<br />
recently been thinking about relationships and community. i have
little involvement in the queer community so i've been thinking of
ways to explore that. open to ideas here! :-)<br />

causes one to ponder what really is important...","figuring things out. fixing things (not people!). pulling shit out

promoted as a business book while enlightening me more than any
other book on interpersonal relations between people with shared
goals. great works tht everyone should read: ""the selfish gene"" and

less hectic at some point. *fingers crossed*)</b><br />

____________<br />
as my friend <a href=""http://www.okcupid.com/profile/temerity_jonez"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">temerity_jonez</a> will tell you, i am really, really
picky about who i spend my all-too-scant free time with. seriously,
she gives me shit about this *all* the time.<br />
<br />
i'm a pretty earnest person who's big on communication &amp; wears
their heart on their sleeve. if i like you, i like you--and i will
explicitly tell you so. and i'll want to revel in smitten kittendom
because it gives me the effervescence that helps to stave off the
<i>14-hours-in-the-library-reading-high-theory madness</i>.<br />
<br />
so don't court me unless you actually might want to hang around for
a while. i don't mean that in a 'let's u-haul' kind of way (ew, no
thanks *shudder*), just that i don't really do the casual thing
anymore, so i'm not looking for a karma chameleon (i.e., you come
&amp; go).<br />
<br />
and chances are i won't respond unless you are original, creative,
responsible, respectful, passionate, &amp; purposeful, with perhaps
a touch of whimsy.<br />
<br />
____________<br />
that said, you should <u>definitely</u> message me if:<br />
<br />
...you can dance with your whole body &amp; soul like no one's
watching; like to roll around with a bottomless belly-full of
laughter in grass on a sunny afternoon; sing in the shower; feel
like sometimes your heart just isn't big enough to hold all the
wonder in the world; have passion and purpose and some sense of the
path you're walking in this, your one wild and epic life; &amp; are
looking for a partner in crime for your shenanigans.<br />
<br />

15529,53,athletic,,not at all,never,graduated from college/university,"things about me? i'm pretty easy-going and love to be with people
who complement my personality (that usually equates to many
opposite traits, interests and characteristics - after all, another
me could be terribly boring!). while we'd both share the same core
values, it would be much more fun to learn new things with someone.
traveling is always fun, but for me, the best part is coming home
again. i have been fortunate to have been a number of places to
learn about other lifestyles, however, a vacation where there is
beach, water, and palm trees and an ocean breeze will always be
welcomed.<br />
<br />
i love cooking for friends, hanging out and laughing like crazy,
watching movies (on the couch and snuggling with someone is, of
course, the preferred choice) and working on projects around the
house or for others. i have a huge soft spot for animals and am a
believer in ""an eye for an eye"" when it comes to punishing animal
abusers. i'm not an outdoorsy girl, so you if you'd like someone to
hike, bike, scuba, ski or climb halfdome with you, you probably
need to look elsewhere...<br />
<br />
i come from a large chinese family where laughter is the key. we're
traditional in that we value the family first. we're also a rather
wacky bunch, which makes everything fun. you should also be warned
that i have a bit of a smartass side to me, but it's always just in
good casual fun and never hurtful. my friends are my support system
and i value all relationships as the most important thing in my
life.<br />
<br />
my work now allows me time to put family and friends first - this
was not always the case but it's a priority now.<br />
<br />
i'm the eternal optimist and truly believe there is someone out
there who is just perfect for me (and me for him) to hang out with,
cuddle with, who can make me laugh, gives a great massage, takes
good care of himself, can laugh at himself and is happy hearing at
how my day went even if it's the most boring thing in the world.
you offer witty reparte or a snappy comeback as a situation
dictates. you are generous and young in all the important ways (at
heart, in spirit, in years maybe) but mature enough to be an adult
when required. i also love cooking and eating so you'd better be a
foodie, too!<br />
<br />
lastly, i have no baggage! :) if interested, please drop me a
line!<br />

personal goods, a couple friends in the bay area, but now i call

have had great luck building a great network of friends, have
become very familiar with sf, and have the time to enjoy life the
way i have always wanted... time for me to meet some girls who are
not scared to step away from the norm, enjoy or are open to sharing
my hobbies, who are driven by something (whatever that may be), and
someone who is capable of teaching me something new (loosely
defined).<br />
<br />
before coming to sf, i worked in banking for 3 years in nyc. in
addition to giving me a strong backbone for what i do now, the time
in new york taught me a lot about what i like, who i am, what
drives me, and most it important framed a particular viewpoint that
dictates how i live my life now: 1) start living your life as life
is pretty short as it is, 2) find something you're passionate about
because life without passion life is a pretty mundane one to live
and 3) listen to your instincts, as they are usually right.<br />

this is soozyqz's sister.<br />
<br />
on december 3rd, my sister s. was hit and killed by a car while
riding her bike.<br />
<br />
i just figured out how to access her okcupid profile. for all of
you who knew her here, she loved okcupid. it gave her a chance to
meet people, have fun with language, explore the world - thanks to
okq and all of you for expanding her life so wonderfully.<br />
<br />
s's wit, intelligence, and sparkling sense of fun are terribly
missed. i'll leave her profile and material up because it's so
damned funny and like her, and because it means a little of her is
still around.<br />
<br />
============================<br />
what follows is s's own text<br />
============================<br />
<br />
tripper...<br />
big time tripper...<br />
big big time time time tripper tripper tripper tripper...<br />
<br />
now whisper that aloud to yourself... do it again only a little
faster with a little character in your voice, a sing-song rhythm...
mind the pattern, especially the word <em>time</em> as three... go
ahead, try it.<br />
<br />
ahhhhhhhh!!!... it's like something opens up... interesting,
yes?<br />
<br />
new stuff on top of stuff once new, and in homage to halloween...
i've decided to have my headstone digitalized, and this video will
be playing on it:<br />
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kehxdue2h48&amp;feature=youtu.be<br />

<br />
this just in: i edited my profile and added thoughts with the words
""poop"" and ""pee"" in them and within minutes of posting it, eight
men visited me... almost at once, two of them came back for a
second visit within 5 minutes of the first; it begs the question,
it really does.<br />
<br />
item 2: i just got sick of myself, just this minute; i've edited
this profile so many times, re-read it each time, gone back to
re-read every time someone compliments me on it to reassure myself
that i am, indeed, as clever as they think i am... all of this
preening and punctuating... my god... it's too much, i'm breaking
up with myself-right now.<br />
<br />
for myriad reasons, some of them shameful to admit, some of them
evolving, i have no digi-pic of myself that's at all
representative... i mean, a pink bouffant, sassy as it is, a fair
representation of me, is not... wait a second, i could be wrong
about that... gotta think it through, do i want to post a bunch of
pics... i used to have an interesting discussion about this, now i
have interesting ideas for photos.<br />
<br />
anyway, i think you should know that i'm reasonable, and fair, and
until i get this photo thing put together--and that's going to have
to wait until i take my christmas decorations down--i'm perfectly
willing to show up for our first meeting without make-up, wearing
my bra on the outside of my shirt.<br />
<br />
what cheek, huh?<br />
<br />
three times now i've tried to edit that last bit out and three
times, i find it still there when i return to my profile.<br />
<br />
i dunno, i guess it'll weed out the less stalwart amongst
you.<br />
<br />
for a quick start, i weigh 117 lbs, and i'm built like a bobcat,
that is to say, compact, or in what's probably the proper okq
parlance, petite (leaving out anything about strong), and my
favorite color is pink, okay, not really, it's every shade of green
well beyond the point at which it becomes blue.<br />
<br />
blonde hair, light green eyes, two of them, people say i look
eastern european, angles and planes i guess, maybe nose too, kinda
hebe, the nose, teeth straight... my mouth is not thin-lipped,
neither is my disposition... but then, now you have a photo to look
at and you can easily see... that i dunno, green is my favorite
color and my teeth are straight?<br />
<br />
i ride a bicycle everywhere except for the places to which i
rollerskate... quads (not in-lines).<br />
<br />
i feel i should say here that i just got the skates a couple of
months ago, riding my bike wasn't feeling enough like flying
anymore, and i'm having so much fun on them i'm in danger of losing
my mind.<br />
<br />
i'm still my own best friend, i know, everybody says that, but this
is real... when i start to toss around phrases like <em>energetic
states</em> and <em>paradigm shifts</em> and <em>pools of
metaphor</em> too often, i'm still the only person i can count on
to tell me to ""shut the fuck up... you sound like a tosser and
you're making me want to toss"".<br />
<br />
until i find new words i like to refer to such things, i think
tagging <em>and shit</em> to the end of them dignifies them a
little.<br />
<br />
i know i sound flip, what can i say? i guess i am, irreverent at
the very least, and unapologetic about it.<br />
<br />
it's a quality i've probably cultivated as protection for an
exquisitely sensitive inner being.<br />
<br />
am i concerned that i'll put people off?<br />
<br />
not so much; i think that exquisitely smart and sensitive people
are aware of people's layers.<br />
<br />
me? i find people with many layers simply more stimulating.<br />
<br />
and in <em>summary</em> of myself?... i direct you to consider that
my favorite parts of the road trip--and i adore the road trip--are
singing out loud to music playing on the car stereo, and spending
the night in a tacky motel with a tiny swimming pool that looks out
onto the parking lot.<br />
<br />
i love the smell of the cheap carpeting and the institutional bath
linens, and the clack-clacking of the vinyl blades of the vertical
blinds.<br />
<br />
and gassing the car up at night in a corporate superstation off of
a superhighway under a cold and steadfast glare of blue-white
light, the cars and the semi's fly past like whining insects...
past the smell of french fries and bacon and engine
exhaust...<br />
<br />
under a canopy of stuttering yellow fluorescence, the battered
one-man operation off the two-lane highway is just as delicious,
with one horsefly, and two gas pumps that mark the passage of
dollars with cash register bells... the vapors from the vintage
nozzles co-mingle with the smell of wild grasses in an intoxicating
miasma... and at nighttime, the only sound you hear above the
ding-dinging of the bell is the male cricket rubbing his wings
together, the serrated edge of a little toothed vein at the bottom
of one wing drawn across the smooth top of the other, like a
meth-addled hillbilly in love on a musical saw.<br />
<br />
the nozzle is a dime-store pistola in your hand, with a shiny metal
trigger that rattles in its housing like a loose tooth pinned to
the jawbone of a skull with wire.<br />
<br />
an acoustic guitar plays with a piano in the background as i play
with this image, and i think of my brother carr and the dime-store
pistola he put to his head, and the road trip we took together one
night after he died... my eyes moisten and pool.<br />
<br />
he did much of the driving; parking meters and brick walls teased
the windshield as we careened through the city before heading out
of town... or was the windshield taunting them?<br />
<br />
odd how he's become younger as i've grown older... he's my baby
carr-carr now, yet the memories he and i share are of him as my
older brother by three years... even his name was beautiful.<br />
<br />
and as to what my intentions are on this site, a man i communicated
with this morning lightly scoffed the dedicated seekers of sex and
soul mate and described his search with these words: ""... i'm more
like a geologist walking along a riverbed, cracking rocks open to
see if i can find a lovely geode.""<br />
<br />
i loved his image, and it spoke to my own purpose here.<br />
<br />
of course i hope to meet someone lovely with whom i can refine an
intimacy, the quality of which surpasses all others in my life to
this point, and i travel in waters deep... but time spent on other
planes has shown me that i don't require the things that i want the
most.<br />
<br />
i would describe my hunting style as similar to his, well... as i
think about it... i've been very playful, and more than a little
predatory this summer, what with being on break from school and
all, but school starts in about twelve minutes, and then i expect
i'll be strolling the riverbed cracking open rocks instead of
hiding behind pink bushes and timing a pounce.","writing, school, rollerskating, riding bike, samba...<br />
<br />
i collect vintage bed pans.<br />
<br />
i also collect mercury, big dead bugs, glass eyes, and prosthetic
dental appliances... fledgling collections, these.<br />
<br />
and also quite important? i want you to know that i'm serious about
what i'm studying in school.<br />
<br />
i realize that i may sound fluffy and impertinent but please, let
there be no mistake about it...<br />
<br />
...wow, i forgot what i was going to say...<br />
<br />
nope, as it turns out i didn't... the ellipses said it for me...
well, to be precise, the ellipses helped you say it for me, though
it probably wasn't phrased the way i would have phrased it.<br />
<br />
whatever it is.","let's see, i'm a good student, in spite of myself, and i'm getting
to be a better and better skater.<br />
<br />
i'm good at expressing myself.<br />
<br />
i'm also quite good at finding places to use the ellipses.<br />
<br />
i have an astonishing ability to construct long sentences without
relying on the ellipses, the em-dash, or the semicolon, though i
love them all... you'll find a 152-word sentence about love in the
question section that's grammatically sound, in fact, there's only
one comma that could be replaced by a period and the words ""it is"".
so there.<br />
<br />
oh yeah, and i'm on the interior design team for the place between
that-which-is and that-which-is-not?<br />
<br />

strap, the beta band, the dandy warhols, radiohead, black rebel

radiohead, and blockhead... hmmm, a theme emerges... i fucking love
electric guitars... and i've loved many drummers... i love raisins,
i love lamb, i love butter and half-and-half, and i love love...
mmmmm, some things on this list change and some things don't.<br />
<br />
if i could only listen to one band the rest of my born days i'd be
torn; some days i'd say radiohead, other times i'd want the fall,
but then i remember the summer i spent shackled to my radiator with
pj harvey... nope, it's radiohead; oh christ, then there's yo la
tengo...<br />
<br />
shows? arrested development, the flight of the conchords, the
office, deadwood, seinfeld, weeds, oz, sopranos, big love, the
wire, the corner, the tudors, south park, there's more,
whatever...<br />
<br />
movies, withnail and i, harold and maude, requiem for a dream,
henry: portrait of a serial killer, spun, night of the hunter,
leaving las vegas, panic in needle park, annie hall, eternal
sunshine of the spotless mind, dead man, heat, the assassination of
jesse james by the coward robert t. ford, tombstone--the one with
val kilmer as doc, eye of the beholder, the libertine, the last
temptation of christ, jacob's ladder, being john malkovich...
there's more.<br />
<br />
important thing to note is that, though my tastes in this
department run a little low-brow, i'm not a philistine.<br />
<br />
and clearly, i appreciate a good love story.<br />
<br />
books are difficult for me to name as i'm an experiential reader; i
become immersed in a story, or a voice, and while i'm there, it
becomes my favorite.<br />
<br />
i can often read beloved works again and again with a different
experience each time.<br />
<br />
i think someone once said that books are like rivers, they're
different each time you enter them.<br />
<br />
works that have influenced me... the carlos castaneda collection
(the church of infinity, that's my religion), norma jean the
termite queen, me talk pretty one day, diary of a dope fiend, the
death of artemio cruz, morning of the magicians, anything by
charles fort... okay this is too much, i've read soooo many
wonderful books, and i've left soooo many with their covers
unturned... shite, i can't remember the names of some of the ones i
recall most fondly, okay--oxymoronic--the ones i partially recall
most fondly.<br />
<br />
my favorite quote... ummmm... i know you're not asking but when you
read it? you'll understand why i'm including it and at the very
same time? you'll wonder why:<br />
<br />
i once inhaled a pretty full dose of ether, with the determination
to put on record, at the earliest moment of regaining
consciousness, the thought i should find uppermost in my mind. the
mighty music of the triumphal march into nothingness reverberated
through my brain, and filled me with a sense of infinite
possibilities, which made me an archangel for a moment. the veil of
eternity was lifted. the one great truth which underlies all human
experience and is the key to all the mysteries that philosophy has
sought in vain to solve, flashed upon me in a sudden revelation.
henceforth all was clear: a few words had lifted my intelligence to
the level of the knowledge of the cherubim. as my natural condition
returned, i remembered my resolution; and, staggering to my desk, i
wrote, in ill -shaped, straggling characters, the all-embracing
truth still glimmering in my consciousness. the words were these
(children may smile; the wise will ponder): a strong smell of
turpentine prevails throughout. (oliver wendell holmes, sr.)<br />
<br />
i think the parenthetic aside in the last sentence buttons it up
perfectly; sort of a meta-quote, no?","peter and raymond (shut up little man)...<br />

counter top...","the dust floating across the lens of my eye, bacterial intelligence
(i'm not saying i'm having seminal thoughts about it), whether i
prefer a space after the ellipses (decidedly i do), the aesthetic
of nested punctuation, different outfits to wear, my dream life,
the apartment i'm looking for there, the view of the freeway
complex from the street corner where i stood thinking one day...
there...<br />
<br />
and lately, i spend a lot of time thinking about you.<br />
<br />
i'm going through one of those phases where i'm so taken with your
impossibly adorable best friend yummy sexiness that i feel i must
bite something... i wish it could be you.<br />
<br />
i know that if you were here i wouldn't be able to keep my hands
off of you and you wouldn't be able to keep yours off of me and
we'd kiss and fuck and think and play, and i'd wake you up to tell
you my dreams, and then we'd float back to sleep together on the
comfort of the thought that we'd finally found each other in the
same place at the same time.<br />
<br />
i want to talk to your face so close to mine that you can feel my
eyelashes on your cheek... and my breath leaves tiny warm droplets
on your nose and on your lips.<br />
<br />
and then i want to close my eyes and feel your voice rising up from
your throat and vibrating your lips against my ear.<br />
<br />
i want to wake you up humming a nonsense lullaby with my lips
around your cock, and feel you stiffen outside, and soften inside
as your thoughts dissolve into mine in the crucible of our
subconscious-shared as moments together in the same dream, and i
want to wake up from that dream still dreaming of you.<br />
<br />
i want you to push me up against the peeling wall of a decrepit
building late at night, and under the yellow light of a street
lamp, i want you to pin my arms against the rough surface and kiss
and suck and bite my neck until you feel a shiver run through my
body, and then i want you to keep doing it until my eyes roll back
in my head and i go far, far, far away...<br />
<br />
i watched some movies today and ate some ice cream, skipped school,
should go tomorrow, don't know if i will.<br />
<br />
rain outside is soft and warm and the roses in the yard are
blown-out floozies feeling all moist and sexy and special.<br />
<br />
i haven't described where i live to you yet but after four years it
still takes my words away.<br />
<br />
the colors and forms with which i've sculpted the space send me
into a dreamy fugue state, and sometimes i pass hours dancing among
the rooms with my eyes half shut thinking about everything,
nothing... singing, breathing, remembering...<br />
<br />
in these states i talk to my mom and my brother, and sometimes my
dad, but mostly i talk to you... i'd like to talk to claudia
more.<br />
<br />
claudia's my friend of twenty years and she died about a year and a
half ago from liver disease; she'd been hospitalized several times
in the last five.<br />
<br />
i went to her apartment for tea, she had jack daniels in hers, i
knew we were writing the final page, i told her friends, they told
her family, and i found her body...","let's forget about me for a minute and talk about sponge bob
instead... i mean, for christ's sake, he's a sponge that lives in
the bottom of a pair of women's underwear... you know... bikini
bottom?<br />
<br />
and friday night? who cares.<br />
<br />
i'd rather talk about some of the things i've learned in my short
time on this site.<br />
<br />
first off, i've yet to meet anyone, and i've met scads, whose
physical person is at all what i expect from the photos.<br />
<br />
not to say that they look better, or worse, or even all that
different, just that i never feel like i'm meeting someone of whom
i have any sense of their physical presence, no matter how hard
i've scrutinized their pictures.<br />
<br />
and how this lends itself to the exquisite rawness of the first
encounter fascinates me the most... the first encounter with its
treacherous first moments when our greatest self-doubt is how we'll
look to the other... and the egos of us both are exposed nerves,
and the stuff that leaks out of us and washes across our faces, the
expressions conceived, takes on the character of
each-as-the-observer's insecurity.<br />
<br />
and all of the e-repartee that flutters back and forth with such
energy between two e-paramours before meeting, fertilizes the bed
of the budding relationship.<br />
<br />
and then you meet someone with whom you feel that elusive and
irrational tingling that ferries them into all of your favorite
music, and conspires with insanity to construct such conversations
between you and them in your head that in their presence you almost
feel like they withhold, for the quality of intimacy is so
diminished from that to which you've become accustomed... in the
conversations you've been having... with them in your head.<br />
<br />
this infant relationship is but a seedling, and whether it's of a
variety that will grow lush and full, or more like the fleeting
poppy, with shallow roots and seasoned short, it requires tender
ministrations to survive the transition from the rarefied
conditions of the okq nursery to the hard-scrabble of ordinary
life.<br />
<br />
...to be continued...by the way, my name is lorgnette, and this
profile rightly belongs to the creature whose body i inhabit, an
accomplished and gracious hostess to whom all that is hers shall be
returned, but sometimes... the moment belongs to me... a secret we
now share.<br />
<br />
okay, that's enough from her.<br />
<br />
i'm the ""creature"" and i'm back.<br />
<br />
i think lorgnette's been drinking (from the toilet bowl) again, and
she's waxing a little... well, the metaphor speaks for
itself.<br />
<br />
i'm trying to get her a venue of her very own, maybe some space on
the inside of a bubble gum wrapper, or in highlights
magazine.<br />
<br />
i've pitched an idea to them for a language driven version of
""hidden pictures""... remember that feature? there are 12 tigers
hidden in this picture can you find them? only this would be like:
there are 12 meanings hidden in this sentence can you<br />
find them?<br />
<br />
anyway, she's quite adept at emerging from between things... lines,
words... so until i find something for her of her very own, you'll
have to keep an eye open for her... she likes to sneak in sometimes
and have a piddle... you may have stepped in some up there in the
self summary.","ummm... my mom had a painting in our dining room for years that she
rented from the rochester public library.<br />
<br />
i always have five bathroom towels in circulation for myself: a
hand towel, a face towel, a foot towel, a body towel, and a hair
towel; i've done this since i was in second grade.<br />
<br />
i can swallow eight big vitamin tablets at once with a single sip
of water-no gag reflex.<br />
<br />
i can eat glass, well, i don't swallow anymore because dental work
precludes me from chewing it as well as i need to in order to
swallow it.<br />
<br />
i relish the aftertaste of a small, and contained beer-belch
arising from a sophisticated brew with a texture and taste that are
well designed.<br />
<br />
i can smell the difference between rats and mice whether they're
dead or alive.<br />

peeing in the bathtub is kind've a turn-on, with or without warm
water... it's weird like that.<br />
<br />
i often get so lost in my thoughts that when bathing, i forget
whether or not i've shampooed, or rinsed the conditioner out of my
hair, or even put any in at all, and end up repeating these things
several times.<br />

<br />
oooooh... this should up the ante on private things admitted... i
will share with you what may be the most fucked up dream ever
dreamed in all of life... ever.<br />
<br />
i dreamed that my mom and i were attending a tour of some historic
mansion on a parade of homes of famous dead people, or maybe they
were just dead people, anyway, we were wandering from room to room,
and we were naked, and she was following behind me trying to
finger-fuck me... incessantly!<br />
<br />
i kept reaching behind myself and swatting at her but honestly, it
kind of spoiled the whole tour for me.<br />
<br />
and when i woke up, what was really happening? ummm... for that? i
think you'll have to read the book when it comes out.<br />
<br />
mmmmmm... try to stop me now... you know that part up there under
things i spend lots of time thinking about, where you've pinned me
against the wall of an old building, and you're doing things to my
neck that make me shiver and roll my eyes back and go far, far, far
away...? it starts with kissing and biting...<br />
<br />
oh yeah, and sometimes i get into stare-downs with babies.<br />
<br />
i don't mean to... they start it... and really, i mean, what am i
supposed to do, look away? uhhh... that's not happening.","... you're someone who could get down with just stopping by for a

riding a horsey-on-a-stick... i'll dress as one too.<br />
<br />
... or... or... i could dress up as the oompa-loompa riding the
horsey and, oh my god... wai-wait... this is great... <em>you</em>
could be the guy with the broom and dustpan that trails us--me and
the horsey--and sweeps up our droppings... party droppings, you
know, chewed gum, cherry stems, shoe heels, shell casings, torsos
with the heads chewed off, like at a parade, yes! we'll be a
parade... me and you and a horsey-on-a-stick... a broom and a
dustpan and a bodybag perhaps... your tools will be all spangly,
and your mustache like a whiskbroom atop your lip... of course
you'll party with us, and we'll wait for you to finish cleaning up
wherever we stop...<br />

<br />

you identify too strongly with team sports, unless you're really
hot, but then you must do it at other people's houses, and you
musn't expect me to talk about it, or listen to you talk about it,
no matter how hot you are.<br />
<br />
and by street way i mean: you can run from the fuzz when you need
to, climb a tree if you want, ride a bike without fear in the
street, stay standing upright on a billboard platform, bite a dog
who bites you first... okay, i'm just saying anything right
now.<br />

i cannot abide a baseball cap... exceptions for ones with good
logos, like john deere farm equipment, or somebody's feed n'seed

obviously, i try not to take myself too seriously. i love talking
to people about a wide variety of subjects, from technology to
books to love to war to politics.<br />
<br />
i am enigmatic, affable, and loquacious","i'm writing this profile. more long-term goals include dinner, then
a good book.<br />
<br />
more long-term, i'm enjoying the life of consulting for a large
consulting firm, hopping from project to project. it entails
thinking on my feet, adapting to new situations, and constantly
learning new things. i'm building a solid foundation of knowledge
and expertise, and big companies just love that.<br />
<br />
i'm bitter that i still haven't scaled katahdin (it was sleeting!).
while i love the city, i could see myself living in the <a class=
""ilink"" href=""/interests?i=wilderness"">wilderness</a> for a few
years, or perhaps a prairie. or down under. or up over! no, in all
seriousness, i'd love to visit australia and new zealand. i have a
strong wanderlust that i fulfill every so often. i love to travel,
and i'm always looking for companions to accompany me on new
adventures.<br />
<br />
outside of work, you'll find me biking around the bay area. i'm
also into photography, an occasional run, and looking longingly out
the window at the water.","i'm ridiculously good at responding to these ""what are you good
at?"" questions. you've stuck with me this far, right?<br />
<br />
i guess i'm good at not being serious. there is a time and a place
for sound, logical arguments and discussions. i love having those.
but not in little windows with only courier new to defend myself!
i'd much rather have a discussion over a glass of wine or a tasty
wheat beer in a new cafe we've just discovered.<br />
<br />
people tell me they love my photography. i don't get out and
photograph as much as i'd like, but i do love it. i'd throw frisbee
in the list (no pun inten-- aw, hell, sure it was), but i haven't
scrolled down yet, and i'm sure i can whip out that disc somewhere
else where it would be more useful.","if there were one thing people always noticed about me, i'd
probably build up some sort of complex about it and go live in a
cave.<br />
<br />
kidding. people generally tend to notice that i'm always listening.
i'd rather fully understand what you have to say than to cut you
off and ask for clarification. i pride myself in being a good
listener, and a good friend.","hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy, chuck palahniuk, philip k. dick,
watership down, snow crash, house of leaves, the alchemist, time
traveler's wife, kite runner. but don't get me wrong, there's
plenty of grisham, crichton, and ludlum on my bookshelves!<br />
<br />
on a recent trip home, i dusted off a book of logic that lay
forgotten, the byproduct of a college logic class dropped due to
time constraints. so i read it cover to cover, and then purchased a
philosophy i textbook... we'll see where this goes!<br />
<br />
as for movies: ""waking life"" is both irresistibly charming and
mind-numbingly boring at the same time. i love it! of course, other
favorites include pi, fear and loathing in las vegas, requiem for a
dream, lives of others, into great silence (bonus points if you've
actually seen that!), the wall, fargo, reservoir dogs, lock stock,
snatch, pulp fiction, spaceballs. most any judd apatow film.<br />
<br />
food-wise, i'm a big fan of thai, indonesian, and sushi. this is
definitely not a city for picky eaters. i'll try most anything
once.","light, shadow, music, love, my camera, and a good book.","light. the best time for photography is in the last half hour
before sunset, when the streets turn amber and shadows grow longer.
shadow. i love the night. i wake up early for work, but i'll always
be a night owl.<br />
<br />
sound. music will always get me going. i haven't been clubbing in a
while, but i'll always love trance and techno. it's been a while
since i've played piano (for which i had free lessons for a month),
and i'd really like to pick it up again. (playing, that is).","shooting pool, hanging out at the bar or lounge with friends, or
dancing in a club. that being said, i'm just as happy to have a
chill quiet evening with a few friends, some wine, and a good
movie. it's good to mix it up, and i'm not picky as long as the
company is good!","i've never climbed katahdin -- it was snowing and they'd closed the
trails. i may be on the opposite coast now, but i'll be back there
to hike it!","you're drawn to my savvy wit like a moth to a flame. though i won't
discriminate; you could be any winged insect drawn toward any sort
of incendiary device.<br />
<br />
i'm always looking to meet new people, and this is a great way to
discover people you might not otherwise ever get the chance to
meet. if you'd like to have an intelligent conversation about
politics, a silly one about monty python, or just swap movie
quotes, drop me a line.",white,68.0,-1,computer / hardware / software,2012-03-12-22-16,"san francisco, california",,straight,likes dogs and likes cats,atheism and laughing about it,m,cancer and it&rsquo;s fun to think about,no,"english (fluently), french (okay)",single

utter disregard for doing what i am told to do.","i think a lot about where i am, how the hell i got here, where i
think i might be going. i think a lot about why i can't seem to
find a decent guy, theorize on why the world seems to be going
crazy, stories and things to write about, my own personal
philosophy of life.<br />
<br />
i think about people, why i love them, why they make me cry. i
review the moves that i have made over the course of the day and
speculate how they will shape my path, if i even have a path. i
think about when it's going to hit me that i live in california
now, if i like it here, and why i feel like i am missing something
about it, or if it is like a movie that you like, but would like
more if it hadn't been so hyped up.<br />
<br />
i think about the fact that more than half the time, people
probably have no idea what i am talking about, or that i am
probably thinking something that no one else in the room is. i
think about how everyone tells me how different i am and wondering
if that is really true or if they have a small pool of people for
comparison. i think about the fact that my son is an awesome kid
and how much of that is luck and how much is good parenting.<br />
<br />
i think about the hurtful things that people have done to me and if
it was any fun for them to do them. i think about new ways of
looking at old ideas, my therory of everything, my theory on how
the universe really came into existence and how evolution of life
on earth from single celled critters happened. i think about the
fact that people seem to be comforted by the stories that they make
up, but really, no one has any clue what happened 50 years ago, 100
years ago, 1000 years ago or 10,000 years ago, they just specualte
it based on an interpretation of events that could change tomorrow
based on the discovery of new information.<br />
<br />
i think about what adventures i want to have here and where to
start. i wonder why it is so hard to find people to really talk to
rather than explain to. i think about the fact that everything is
absurd and madness seems the only reasonable conclusion as to how
to navigate through it all. i think about the fact that i would
rather laugh than cry, but i still do a bit more of the latter than
i like to sometimes.<br />
<br />
i think about suicide in the abstract, and how feeling like i want
to kill myself sometimes is probably very reasonable, and only
becomes unreasonable if i were to act on it. i then think that
sometimes everyone else killing themselves, while not without its
logistical challenges, might actually be a better option.<br />
<br />
i think about how the world needs a new myth and there is no reason
why i can't create that narritive. i think about being supreme
dictator of all reality, and that i would probably be good at it. i
think about becoming an evil genius because the world needs one to
counter all of the evil idiots and that it would probably guarantee
me a castle somewhere, which would be cool. i think about time
travel and why it's not impossible, and i think about no matter how
shitty a day i have, tomorrow is a viable solution to what ails
me.<br />

i'm a northern minnesota boy who fell in love at first sight with
the bay; its pleasant temperament and endless surprises recently
brought me back from a temporary work-related dalliance with
michigan.<br />
<br />
i'm genuinely fascinated by people, their thoughts, feelings, and
lives, and have tended towards deep lasting connections with a few
people rather than a wide circle of friends who i'm forever losing
track of. i'm an introvert, in the sense that i find solitude
restorative, but never want to lose the energy and happiness i find
in the people around me.<br />
<br />
i'm close to my family - i like the fact that sometimes we lean on
each other for love and support, and other times we're just
interested in what the rest have been up to. my sister is fond of
saying that, even were she not related to me and my brother, she'd
still want to be friends.<br />
<br />
while i started with all of the innate talent that any stereotypes
might predict of a white man from minnesota, effort and practice
have shown me how amazing dance is . . . i'm currently focusing on
adding west coast swing and blues dancing to salsa and bachata. i
love how it's about connecting with another person with and through
the song - it's an always-new conversation, all through movement
and music.<br />
<br />
i love movies in the theater . . . there's just something about the
immersive (okc informs me this is not a word) experience of it all.
i have more than one friend who'll testify they get as much out of
being at the movie with me as they get out of the movie
itself.<br />

rye; crime and punishment; the power of one; tao te ching; the
sparrow; way past cool; pedagogy of the oppressed; the omnivore's
dilemma; war for the oaks; outliers. lately i've been reading a
bunch of neuroscience for laypersons . . . thinking about the brain

in terms of outdoor activities: i cycled 545 miles from san

epiphany, good friends and great views. the beach is probably my
favorite place on earth to relax. being in and on water is

i am: an optimist, a realist, and a believer in being both; a

mythbuster.<br />

i have: won $200 in a poker tournament and $0 in a poetry slam;
seen three continents, two mountain peaks, and a llama; a goofy

<br />
who i want to meet: someone who is an idealist, a realist, an
intellectual, and a leader; someone who loves sports, trips, and
purposefully getting lost; someone who would beat me in board games

i was in nepal last september - monsoon season - when it rains like
the world is ending almost every afternoon. naturally, in a moment
of infinite intelligence, i rented a mountain bike one day and rode
pretty far up into the mountains. by 3 p.m. i could see no more
than a few feet in front of me.<br />
<br />
tinpiple village - all two buildings of it - became my refuge, and
i stood with the village's ~20 people under their two roofs. we
didn't speak because i don't speak nepalese and they don't speak
english (or spanish). we just stood and watched the monsoon. i
wondered how in the world i was getting home and whether this scene
was real. they wondered whether their home would sustain the
insta-flood and whether the soaking wet dude standing 6 feet tall,
with a bright yellow bike and a bright red helmet was real. i now
know what it feels like to be a national geographic photo waiting
to happen.<br />

<br />
brilliant but underemployed writer seeks not-so-brilliant or better
man or woman for purposes of traveling to culinary worlds beyond
burritos and spaghetti (though those are nice too at the right
moment), visiting cinematic realms not under the aegis of hollywood
(though ""inception"" and ""scott pilgrim vs. the world"" are on the
radar), and encounters with those parts of the world not in thrall
to the gods of wal-mart and nordstrom. the ability to induce a
smile even after an emergence from commuter hell is a definite
plus.<br />
<br />
the long version:<br />
<br />
writing is great. it's part of who i am. what the ability to sling
words together doesn't provide, though, are opportunities to meet
potential significant others. hence, here i am.<br />
<br />
i love to sample new cuisines. ramen bowls and clam chowder are
nice, but sometimes i just want to cut loose with grilled
vegetables on injeera or a nice lentil salad, and i hope you're
game as well. for something like a mc donald's double down, though,
you're definitely on your own.<br />
<br />
yes, i watch a lot of art, indie, and foreign films. traveling in
these cinematic circles allows me to occasionally get ahead of the
popular curve (the original ""paranormal activity"" neener neener). i
don't expect you to also share my taste for agnes varda or mike
leigh, but it would be nice.<br />
<br />
that said, ""casablanca"" is one of my favorite all-time films.<br />
<br />
i also like to travel, because there's an enormous world outside of
where i am that i haven't seen yet. london and paris, for starters,
are two places i ache to visit. return trips to toronto and new
york city would be wonderful. oddly enough, glitz impresses me less
than little surprising discoveries. a favorite surprising discovery
during a las vegas visit was a sort-of museum with working vintage
pinball games.<br />
<br />
the part about seeking a man or a woman is not a typo. i'm
attracted to both men and women to varying degrees. hopefully,
you're not the sort who gets freaked out about that fact. but for
the right person who endears him- or herself to me, i'm yours,
period.<br />
<br />
let's end by asking how you feel about having a conversation with
stephen hawking. would you be intrigued despite hawking's speech
problems, or would you be polite but try to find a way to leave as
soon as possible? if you favor option one, then we definitely need
to talk in person.","aside from the day job which pays the bills, i try to have a life
outside of commuting hell. this means hitting the gym when i can,
curling up with a good book, doing the dani leone cheap eats thing,

there's also the <a class=""ilink"" href=

stage.","playfully letting my imagination run loose, matching films to
tastes, having something of an eye for clothing style","my smile, which is openly warm for the right person.<br />
<br />

say something that will surprise you.","books:<br />

years. my family is extraordinarily important to me and i try to
stay in regular touch with my parents and siblings, but it's
sometimes a challenge, since they all live in oregon, where i grew
up.<br />
<br />
i came down to california for college, where i studied computer
engineering and ended up sticking around the silicon valley,
because that's where the jobs are. i do love it here -- i've made a
home for myself and have a hard time seeing myself ever leave the
amazing friends that i've made in the eight years that i've lived
in california. i do hope to someday live closer to family,
though.<br />
<br />
i've been working a computer programmer for almost five years now
and have a goal of getting a graduate degree someday, but i can't
decide exactly what i study, and until then, i can still make a
decent living. i like my job on most days, but it's not my
life.<br />
<br />
i'm a really big nerd. i love science and technology -- i
especially like learning about outer space, the universe in
general, and our place in it. i'd love to work for nasa someday
(probably sometime after i get that grad degree).<br />
<br />
most of my spare time is spent watching funny tv shows on netflix,
playing video games, playing any kind of board or card game with
friends, watching or playing soccer, on the phone with family, and
never quite doing as much reading as i feel i should. i also enjoy
recreational shooting, but don't have any interest in
hunting.<br />
<br />
i'm a pretty laid guy that likes going out and having fun as much
as staying at home and relaxing. i'm intelligent, a good listener,
compassionate, and a loyal friend. my sense of humor is heavily
sarcastic with soft spot for horrible puns. also, i find that
writing self-descriptions like these make me really uncomfortable,
as i really don't like bragging about myself too much. you're much
more likely to hear me talking up my brothers' and sister's
accomplishments than my own.<br />

answering - i've answered a couple of these incorrectly with
hilarious results...","i'm still trying to figure this out, actually. if i thought i could

interact with the world than the alternative<br />
- i'm really easy to get along with, i usually try to avoid
conflict","books:<br />
lately i've been into sci-fi novels -- i'm just finishing a 5-book
series by peter hamilton that's been described as a ""space opera"".
i also enjoy non-fiction, with a special interest in ww2 history.
my last two reads in that category were ""helmet for my pillow"" and
""with the old breed"", which the hbo series the pacific was based
upon. my next project will be stephen hawking's ""the grand design"",
but i doubt i'll get to that before i can take some vacation time
this summer.<br />
<br />
shows:<br />
comedy is a big part of who i am. what's the point of a life
without laughter? as van wilder says: ""you shouldn't take life too
seriously, you'll never get out alive"". my favorite shows include
the daily show &amp; colbert, himym, futurama, scrubs, south park,
30 rock, archer, the big bang theory, and psych. i also love crime
dramas, too: when i was little, i wanted to be a detective when i
grew up. wants and desires change when you get older, but i still
romanticize the idea of catching bad guys to make the world a
better place. my favorites include ncis, criminal minds, castle,
and bones. and as any good nerd worth their salt does, i love
sci-fi shows and movies a la star trek, star wars, the matrix, and
firefly.<br />
<br />
music:<br />
i'm bonkers for classic rock. the beatles are my all-time favorite,
but i also have soft spots for dylan, clapton, james taylor, bob
marley, the eagles, the red hot chili peppers, guns 'n roses, led
zeppelin, jimi hendrix, bob marley, and many others. i also enjoy
jazz and classical music -- tastes that i picked up learning
trumpet in my high school days. i haven't played in years, but my
horn is still sitting in my closet, waiting for a good cleaning to
start practicing again.<br />
<br />
food:<br />
chinese and mexican foods are my absolute favorites, but i'm not
very picky at all. i enjoy trying new foods and will try just about
anything once, so long as it's not the kind of thing you might have
seen on fear factor. i love spicy food, maybe to a fault. last
christmas, santa brought me a wonderful bottle of hot-sauce from
guatemala.<br />
<br />
movies:<br />
i have a real passion for watching movies. i grew up in a small
town where there often wasn't much else to do for a kid who wasn't
into partying. my list of favorites is probably too long, so i'll
just say that these are my top genres: comedy (naturally), action,
westerns, sci-fi, fantasy, and dramas. there are several movies
that i could quote almost from start to finish: dumb and dumber,
star wars, the matrix, and anchorman, for example.","- family and friends<br />

i prefer deep to superficial. i like the idea of ""living more

still beats me at chess...i'm going to have to practice way more!).
i enjoy being physically active (running, yoga, hiking), and i also
enjoy just kicking it on the deck with a good book. some of my
newest interests are vermiposting and cultivating a plot in the
community garden. i'd like to get more into mountain biking. i'm
more drawn to nature than i am to the city, although i'd love to be
taken on a city adventure that would blow my mind and challenge me
to second guess that statement!<br />

i enjoy movies...mostly those that have a positive message...and
comedies! i don't meditate in the conventional manner, but am very
contemplative and reflective. i drink, yet only very<br />

enjoy<br />

i'm a multi-lingual un kid, meaning my family moved from country to

not obsessed with the gym, i do go several times a week - i
treasure my health. other big passions of mine are cars,

read einstein by isaacson next.<br />

movies: anything that sucks me in. from the lives of others to the
lord of the rings, with godfather and amorres perros and everything

7881,37,athletic,,not at all,,graduated from college/university,"i'm a pleasure seeker with a thirst for adventure and a strong work
ethic. as much as i treasure my bohemian northern californian
lifestyle and values, i cannot escape the influence of my breeding
as a chicago born, east coast educated, jewish american princess
(friends here say my upbringing gives me an edge). my family is
super important to me and we're really close, despite the 1,000's
of miles between us. and with my family of birth being so far away,
i feel really fortunate that i've created a really solid chosen
family out here with amazing and inspiring friends; supportive,
collaborative colleagues and most importantly, my dog.<br />
<br />
i love to surf, paddleboard, hike, camp, backpack, skinny dip, soak
in hot springs, travel to warm places, dance, go on road trips,
make frowning people smile, cause a little trouble, take
photographs and discuss art, politics and the teachings of the
buddha. i love to get messy, and still clean up so well that no one
would ever guess that we were just rolling in the dirt.<br />
<br />
a lot of people call me bossy, which i totally admit to, but i
think of it more as being clear about what i want and need. i've
been called intense in ways that were both hot and difficult for
men.<br />
<br />
i am sweet, salty, and a little bit spicy... just like the food i
enjoy.","i'm self employed in a variety of ways, but mostly, my job is to
help people relax... i teach yoga, i help babies be born and keep
their parents present while it happens. i take photographs of this
momentous event and do my best to help the parents make conscious
choices. i get to say the word ""vagina"" at work a lot, which i
really enjoy!<br />
<br />
i feel so blessed that i've had the chutzpah to create a
meaningful, creative, sustainable and challenging career for
myself. i can honestly and humbly say that when i go to work, i am
helping to make the world a happier, healthier place. work often
feels like play and it changes all the time, so i'm almost always
feeling inspired, excited and fulfilled.<br />
<br />
other than getting paid to be the mellowest person in the room, i
love to travel (locally, domestically and internationally), be
outside, ride my bike around the mission, hang with friends and
family and follow my dog around the bay area. to balance out all
the running around i do, i attend a weekly meditation group where i
practice sitting still. i surf or paddleboard 1-2x a week and
always look for more ocean time whenever possible. i spend more
time outside than any other city dweller i know. my pleasure
principle is very high, in case you haven't noticed.<br />
<br />
i've traveled all over the world and leave the country at least
once a year. some of my favorite places have been tanzania (climbed
kilimanjaro), florence, tiny islands in greece, thailand, india (to
study yoga with the iyengars), mexico and costa rica. closer to
home, i love tassajara, big sur, the sierras, the sonoma coast, brc
and mid-week hikes in montara.<br />
<br />
i'm also really curious... i love to learn... about so many things,
but especially about the body, health and healing. there's an
anatomy book on my kitchen table now, along with a braising
cookbook.<br />
<br />
i'm working on a book and aspire to be interviewed by teri gross on

<br />
beyond the physical, people often say that they find me to be

occasionally people find me to be cool, standoffish or quiet. i

it's not really music, but i love npr, especially this american

my present and my future.<br />

experience while registering myself as a qpoc and unlearning my own

<br />
for potential study partners: i definitely need study partners more
than anything. i just need scheduling and motivation to separate my
times. i don't bother you while you work. don't worry, i will not
attack you or try to know you biblically when we study
together.<br />
<br />
for potential beneficial friends, i don't believe in chemistry, so
go for it :) my no-no are perfumes, smartphones + ipads (i don't
think i have time for our favorite youtube video search, or patient
for loadings).<br />
<br />
for potential romantic partners: this has been historically my
mating season (i myself was presumably produced by my piscean
parent in june), but i am not attached to specific people right
now. i am more interested in short terms and platonic study
partners, seriously.<br />

for potential tanning partners: this section meaning just ""friends""
actually, in a real sense. i am trying to get more tan on my back,
as a beach bum in oakland who doesn't own a car, it's just a thing
that i need to maintain. spend a few hours with me in my yard while

with my kids (if they're home... both are away at college); play
the drums (in the garage), race cars (and try not to kill myself),
lecture undergraduates, coach track &amp; field, tend to my
vines... go for morning runs. not all in the same day... and
work.<br />
i travel to enjoy art &amp; the local culture (picasso, miro,
braque, matisse), explore the early morning streets of rome, paris,
barcelona &amp; central park and try to learn a little more about
life. i teach &amp; i coach because i've been blessed and its a way
of giving back. i support my family, friends, my kids and my ex in
all their endeavors because that's how i was raised. i'm thankful
for great parents and try to emulate their skills... i don't always
succeed.","running companies... coaching... finding creative ways to solve

books: last five: <i>psychoanalytic diagnosis</i>; <i>up in the old
hotel</i>; <i>the heart of the matter</i>; <i>cloud atlas</i>;
<i>clinical practice with adolescents</i>. the trend is now more
fiction and literary nonfiction, less psychoanalytic and counseling
theory, and what a relief. <i>pale fire</i>, by vladimir
vladimirovich nabokov, was once my favorite. it's hard to choose
favorites, though. other favored books are <i>giovanni's room</i>
(i've read this maybe four times, it's always beautiful and
heartbreaking), <i>the sheltering sky</i>, <i>the book of
disquiet</i>, <i>le spleen de paris</i>, <i>nightwood</i>, <i>to
the lighthouse</i>, <i>the heart is a lonely hunter</i>, <i>tender
buttons</i>, things by edgar allan poe, arthur conan doyle, joyce,
kafka, dostoevsky...there are so many other favorites. i'm fond of
gothic fiction, particularly the american gothic tradition and its
various literary permutations (from charles brockden brown and poe,
through wharton, faulkner and mccullers to o'connor and beyond). i
read mostly texts on psychology and counseling for the past two
years, but the last 10 books i read for my own enjoyment and
bothered to list on goodreads are: <i>role models</i> by john
waters; <i>a high wind in jamaica</i> by richard hughes;
<i>watership down</i> by someone great; <i>my antonia</i> by willa
cather; <i>the passage</i> by justin cronin; <i>room</i> by emma
donoghue; <i>the old man and the sea</i> (en espanol); <i>a wrinkle
in time</i> by madeleine l'engle (i forgot what an odd book this is
for children to read); <i>the devil in the white city</i> by erik
larson; <i>japanese tales of mystery and imagination</i> by edogawa
rampo. that last author is pretty daffy. he really wanted to be
edgar allan poe so he changed his name to the japanese phonetic
equivalent and tried to write stories like him. they're not bad.
through reading, esp. fiction, the world becomes more textured,
meaningful, wonderful. people who don't get that are on a different
trip from me.<br />
<br />
movies and tv: i don't own a television, but i do watch tv shows on
the pooter, most recently the wire, breaking bad, sherlock, downton
abbey. some old favorites are rome, the young ones, jeeves and
wooster, the adventures of pete and pete, sifl and olly, father
ted, fawlty towers, black adder, ab fab, iron chef (the original),
the comic strip presents, freaks and geeks, hitchhiker's guide to
the galaxy, red dwarf, flight of the conchords. oh and the gong
show. loved me some chuck barris.<br />
<br />
as for favorite films, that could be a long list. a few directors i
like: guy maddin, wong kar wai, akira kurosawa, woody allen, robert
altman, jim jarmusch. directors i do not like include lars von
trier. i also have a thing for rock musicals like jesus christ
superstar, phantom of the paradise, hedwig &amp; etc.<br />
<br />
musix: i can't decide where to begin. here are the last five albums
i've purchased (or otherwise acquired): <i>shona mbira music</i>;
erica azim <i>healing music of zimbabwe</i>; kasai allstars <i>in
the 7th moon, the chief turned into a swimming fish and ate the
head of his enemy by magic</i> (on an african music kick);
prokofiev <i>concertos for violin</i>; ofwgkta <i>the of tape vol.

<br />
favorite food: i appreciate good food, i eat locally and
sustainably produced when i can, but i'm pretty non-dogmatic when
it comes to dietary choices and when i eat fast food i don't think
twice about it (besides a mental note to buy some more groceries).",never do <i>what</i> without?,"how to reinvent the wheel into a more inefficient and entertaining

fixing pretty much anything when it breaks. i enjoy <a class=
""ilink"" href=""/interests?i=traveling"">traveling</a> and checking
out the exotic architecture of far-away places, and of course, the
great cuisine.<br />
ever since my father gave me a camera when i moved away to europe,
i've been hooked on <a class=""ilink"" href=
""/interests?i=photography"">photography</a>. landscape photography
has enabled me to travel to places i never would have imagine
going.<br />
<br />
i also enjoy getting outdoors. i grew up on a ranch and enjoy
activities that involve exploring and getting lots of fresh air. at
least once per month, i have a ""thousand mile weekend"" where i go
1,000 miles on my motorcycle taking awesome landscape photos.<br />
<br />
i am very honest and to the point, so for better or worse; you will
know what i am thinking if you ask and sometimes even if you don't.
;) my sister says i'm kind of loud too. but i'm lots of fun and
everyone i know says i'm the best cook in town.<br />
<br />
after serving in the u.s. military, i moved to san francisco, where
i have lived for almost four years. after texas, europe, and the
middle east, san francisco was definitely something of a culture
shock. but, i have grown to appreciate what the city has to
offer.<br />
<br />
i am looking for a serious relationship with an intelligent woman
with a good sense of humor. values and principles are important to
me and i look forward to meeting someone with confidence in her
convictions. a woman with a quick wit who can call me on my bs and
keep me on my toes would be a great plus as well.","enjoying the stability that comes with having a great job and not
having to relocate regularly. developing my culinary skills, and
exploring the west coast on my motorcycle.","cooking and grilling. i wanted to be a chef when i was little, so
my mother taught me how to cook, and my dad taught me how to grill
the perfect steak. my brother-in-law wishes my sister cooked as
well as i do. ;)<br />
<br />
photography. i am certainly not the best photographer in the world,
however i truly enjoy taking photographs. photography has given me
the opportunity to go places i never would have visited otherwise.","that i have a firm handshake, i'm very confident, and always look
people in the eyes. and of course, my smile!","anything by tom clancy, clive cussler, paulo coehlo, ayn rand,
michael crichton or james patterson.<br />
<br />
even though tom cruise is a wacko, top gun is still the greatest
movie ever! i like every movie produced by jerry bruckheimer.
lately i have been filling up my dvr with movies from tcm. it's
amazing, but some of the best movies were made 50-60-70-80 years
ago... ""philadelphia story"" is one of my favorite movies. i also
really enjoy anything with cary grant, jimmy stewart, or kathrine
hepburn. and no matter how many times i watch it, i always enjoy
""you can't take it with you!""<br />
<br />
i like rock, pop, country, dance, big bands. i'm also a great
dancer thanks to those lessons my parents made me take way back
when.<br />
<br />
i'm a meat and grilled vegetables guy. a medium-rare rib eye,

<br />
-i just got back from singing mandarin opera for a month in
beijing. i took intensive mandarin classes every day while i was
there. all the things i can say in chinese fall neatly into two
categories - things that are highly practical and highly
dirty.<br />
(boom - proof that it happened.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt_hvqjwcoo)<br />
<br />
-the coolest job i ever held was singing jazz on a cruise ship from
istanbul to venice.<br />
<br />
-i am a decent whistler but i can only do it sucking in rather than
blowing out. i am also a decent finger snapper, but i can only snap
using my pinky. i worry that these things mean i'm wired
wrong.<br />
<br />
-i had the nickname ""snail girl"" in middle school that resulted
from a traumatic 10th birthday party. ask for the whole
story.<br />
<br />
-i played the violin since the age of 4, but i haven't practiced
since high school.<br />
<br />
-i really like the word ""shenanigans.""<br />
<br />
-i appreciate and enjoy awkward situations and sometimes create
them, though i would like to think this is part of my charm.<br />
<br />
-i'm vegetarian and i have, to the best of my knowledge, never
tasted beef.<br />
<br />
-i can't taste cherries. i've tried soooo many different kinds.
they just don't have any discernible flavor to me.<br />
<br />
-if this sentence doesn't finally get my profile length to 1,000
words, then i am just giving up.","i'm a grad student majoring in operatic vocal performance, and my
aspiration is to bring the world to its knees through the power of

enough to travel to france, italy, germany, the czech republic,
hungary, poland, austria, england, scotland, mexico, canada, china,
barbados, turkey, croatia, and greece. i was singing opera in most
of these places which i think is neato because i pretty much get to
be a professional international make-believer.<br />

my biggest thing is i love having fun. whether it's laughing with
friends, playing soccer (addicted), skiing (also addicted), riding
my motorcycle, or whatever else, i'm there. i try new things as
much as i can because i know that there's more out there to
enjoy.<br />
<br />
i studied computer science in college, and i've been learning ever
since. i have an engineering mindset, so if something works in a
certain way, i want to learn how and why. there's a lot behind the
things that power our world, and i'm always learning something new
about them.<br />
<br />
i'm confident in myself and my decisions, but in a quiet way. i
don't like to flaunt myself, i'd rather let my actions do the
talking.<br />
<br />
i can be blunt, but i'm extremely honest and trustworthy, and i
would expect a match to be the same. underlying all that, i know
who i am and what &amp; who i love and i stick with it/them, even
though others might disagree. i value others' respect, but life's
too short not to live it honestly.<br />
<br />
and finally, i'm pretty sarcastic and have a sense of humor that
alternates between clever (at least i like to think so!) and dirty.
think always sunny in philadelphia / archer style humor. there are,
of course, places i never go with my humor, but i believe in not
taking yourself too seriously.","i work as a backend software engineer (not what it sounds like -
get your mind out of the gutter!) at a great tech company in san
francisco. the work i do is challenging, and the people i work with
are amazing. i think of them as my west-coast family.<br />
<br />
when i'm not working, i love getting outside. i play soccer 3-4
times a week, go trail running on weekends, and go skiing wherever
and whenever i can. it's tough to explain, but keeping active like
this makes me mentally stronger, and an overall better man.","if i love something, i get good at it. right now, those things are

i have done a lot of personal work which has freed me up to be
myself and avoid drama. i strive to have a compassionate heart and
look for a partner who has similar values.<br />
<br />
my first grandchild (a little boy) is now 21 months old and i love
watching him grow &amp; develop. i currently provide childcare for
him one or two days a week. he is a true joy and of course i think
he is quite brilliant! i am enjoying the creativity involved in
providing care for him and must admit, i think i am doing a better
job than i did the first time around with my own children. i have
an added blessing in that i have a new baby granddaughter for whom
i will be providing some care as well.","being a friend in that i am loyal and caring. i am good at being in
the moment and feeling gratitude for the simple joys in life. i am
not a perfectionist which makes for a lighter and less stressful
life.",is that i am tall (5 ft. 9 in.) and (hopefully) my hazel eyes.,"a couple favorite reads are unbound by laura hillenbrand and the
paris wife. i have enjoyed the books by jeanette walls (the glass
castle &amp; half broke horses), the lacuna by barbara kingsolver,
books by lisa see, and am currently reading swamplandia and the
sense of an ending. i found boomerang by michael lewis to be
informative about the debt crisis, and eric larsson's in the garden
of beasts, to be sobering but informative also.<br />
<br />
i like documentaries and movies inspired by true events (bernie,
red tails, my week with marilyn), and movies that have
psychological twists (the descendants, shame, jeff who lives at
home, footnote). i just saw the five year engagement and found it
funny and poignant. i host an annual oscars party for my movie
loving friends whom i affectionately refer to as the movie mavens.
i watch little tv but try not to miss sixty minutes, and some
favorites on pbs like washington week in review and frontline. i
love downton abbey and can't wait for the next season.<br />
<br />
i really enjoy plays and have season tickets to the contra costa
civic theater in el cerrito. the performances are amazing; i just
saw rabbit hole and will see west side story this summer. i just
saw the music man performed by high schoolers at benicia high. i
loved it. for the last scene, they used some members of the bhs
band in their uniforms to play 76 trombones. it was so sweet, i was
close to tears.<br />
<br />
my music tastes are eclectic: i like rock and roll, easy listening,
folk, country, spirituals, new age, and mostly anything with a nice
tune and beat. i like the music of adele, sugarland, taylor swift,
tracy chapman, and older groups like fleetwood mac. i must admit
that i still have a ways to go to appreciate jazz. even better than
listening to music is dancing to music.<br />
<br />
i particularly like mexican, chinese, and thai food. i am also
satisfied with simple fare that is healthy. i enjoy experimenting
with new recipes with the help of a great website (allrecipes.com).

written.<br />
<br />
2) 1984 -- while i actually like his historical narrative better
these days, this had a huge effect on me, and every time i return
to it i discover something new. i'm continually amazed by the
timelessness of the themes.<br />
<br />
3) steinbeck's cannery row series -- endlessly entertaining, it's a
shame that mac and the gang are probably gone forever.<br />
<br />
other favorites: letters of insurgents, out of the night, papillon,
without a glimmer of remorse, revolution of everyday life.<br />
<br />
or really anything by william gibson, michel houellebecq (he's a
fucking jerk but annoyingly insightful), or neil stephenson<br />
<br />
the only movies i've watched more than once:<br />
<br />
1) hackers -- what can i say, watching this as a 15 year old
hacker, it was hard not to be excited about the future.<br />
<br />
2) i heart huckabees -- brilliant.<br />
<br />
3) rushmore -- easily my favorite movie, and max fischer was my
hero for years.<br />
<br />
4) the big lebowski -- just straight entertaining.<br />
<br />
some musical favorites: allergic to bullshit, catharsis, girl and
twin, hickie, the gateway district, requiem, zegota, the mountain
goats, slow teeth","a sleeping bag, a narrative, co-conspirators, a project, the ocean,
warm nights","questions of how it might be possible to radically redefine my

36432,31,average,mostly vegetarian,not at all,never,graduated from masters program,"i'm an australian/singaporean who grew up largely in california,
studied in sweden, went to teach english in china, grad school in
boston, then floated all around germany for a couple years on a
random fellowship before coming back here (boston+s.f.bay -- i live
partially in both cities) to start a company making mobile games to
teach foreign languages.<br />
<br />
an experimenter/tinkerer at heart, i love always creating and
learning new things  from poi dancing to linguistic structures. on
the one hand, i tend to take life seriously and stay focused on
always working to accomplish all that i'm capable of. on the other,
i like being able to just enjoy whatever comes in life. i guess,
here's how one of my best friends once described me:<br />
<br />
""ravi...what can i say? he is full of contradictions! he hates
school and yet, he conquered the two top schools in the country. he
likes solitude and yet he has a million of friends. he is a
computer geek who loves the poetry of gibran. he is, for sure, the
best travel partner ever!""","so, growing up, a lot of my friends were involved with the united
nations and international affairs. with that, i developed a huge
appreciation for the importance of working to further international
justice and human affairs. at the same time, though, i watched how
helpless they always felt and jaded many of them became as they
entered the political realm, so i wanted to work in other areas of
global/cultural awareness.<br />
<br />
throughout high school i was exceptionally bad at learning foreign
languages (drop me in mexico at the time, i'd never be able to find
a bathroom). though, i noticed that even the good students weren't
<i>really</i> learning to speak a second language at any acceptable
rate. for undergrad i wanted to explore different ways of improving
foreign language learning, so i studied linguistics, cognitive
neuroscience and teaching [english]. i found video games actually
made the perfect medium for teaching lots of concepts like foreign
languages, so in grad school i focused specifically on video games
studies.<br />
<br />
i think due to historical reasons, video game designs thus far have
been extremely circumscribed. but, as a medium it's basically this
nexus for the most talented artists across all modalities of
expression to come together: visual artists, composers/sound
designers, script writers, interaction designers, programmers,
choreographers (with systems like the kinect), etc. and you get to
work with all of them, giving them a medium where they can all
collaborate and try to harmonize together  which is a really
beautiful experience with incredible possibilities, i think.<br />
<br />
after graduating i stayed on with a research lab called the mit
education arcade to develop video games to teach mathematics and
logical thinking to jr. high students. and now i'm finally starting
my own company to make [cell-phone] video games for teaching
foreign languages =)<br />
<br />
in terms of relationships, growing up my best friends were actually
mostly older/married and all of social life just kinda had a really
different rhythm to it from the typical teens'n'20's dating scene.
to me, being in a relationship just never seemed genuine when i
knew i was nowhere near ready for something that could lead to
marriage. at least now i've somewhat settled down from my crazy
scrambling to learn all the various pieces for reconceptualizing
the ways people learn foreign languages. also i've somewhat
satisfied my peripatetic side (though i'm still open to more travel
for sure!) and am more likely to spend time exploring the cities i
live in rather than spontaneously taking off to a random chinese
village or hiking around the arctic circle again.<br />
update: apparently i lied when i wrote that. i'll be living in san
francisco, berlin/dublin, tasmania over the coming months and am
still deciding where to live after that (i can work from anywhere
now).","-most things digital/conceptual (as opposed to, say, origami -- as
much as i like it).<br />
-listening, from what i've been told (as opposed to having to come
up with random schmoozing)<br />
-typing really really fast (as opposed to writing anything at all
succinct)<br />
-coming up with interesting ways of learning things<br />
-staying self-motivated for random projects<br />
-i ran the mit salsa club for a few years. i'd love to say that
means i'm really good or even good at it. unfortunately all it
really means is that i think it's a lot of fun.<br />
-trampolining","you know the protagonist in <i>how to tame your dragon</i>? that's
kinda me. though i don't have such a squeaky voice.","music: glashaus / cassandra steen, hayley westenra, perasma, u2,
seal, vanessa mae, kate ryan, sarah brightman, xavier naidoo, owl
city, gigi d'agostino, alize, engelina, zaz. plenty of others, but
that's probably enough for now.<br />
<br />
books: anything by khalil gibran (i think he's the most brilliant
writer ever, not just for the prophet). personal recollections of
joan of arc (definitely favorite novel ever). do they hear when you
cry (excluding the first 100 pages or so). shaking hands with the
devil (incredible &amp; sincere perspectives, painful as it was to
read). rumi.<br />
<br />
movies/tv: avatar: the last airbender (not the movie!), pinky and
the brain. serenity/firefly/nathan fillion in general. matrix (1
always, 2&amp;3 after i got a graduate degree in media studies and
finally became able to understand them). big bang theory. most
movies in the movies_that_matter genre (promises project, amistad,
innocent voices, whale rider, etc). most animated movies / anim.
legend of the seeker. lotr. how lotr should have ended. rowan
atkinson live. i don't even remember what it was called, but there
was an australian cartoon about stick figures drawn in the sand
that each each represented a vowel, and all they'd ever say is that
particular vowel in different intonations as they ran away from
evil consonants. also _die sendung mit der maus_. i hope every
language i have to learn has a show that wonderful!<br />
<br />
food: anything healthy","i'm guessing i'm supposed to go with all the things i really could
do without, but that don't make boring answers (family, etc).

-trader joes<br />
-yoga swing<br />

somewhere in it (dancing, jogging, skating, sailing, yoga, etc)","less serious:<br />
how did people first decide to start drinking milk? video games
that use direct neural controls. breathing patterns, heart-rate
variability rhythms &amp; 12hz brain waves. what life is like for a
4-year old and how not to lose that perspective. random days of
thinking all in german. the potency of fiction &amp; entertainment
media to catalyze people. trying to get the benny lava song and
literal version of total eclipse of the heart out of my head. how
cool those little bikes for 2-year olds with no pedals (laufrder)

it's actually ok to end sentences with copula verbs or
prepositions.<br />
<br />
more serious:<br />
how divided and confused humanity becomes from people feeling like
they have to be able to define, label and quantify
<i>everything</i>. especially when it comes to more abstract topics
like religion. my views on the subject are probably way too nuanced
to fit into an online profile (i'm bahai if that means anything to
you). but, basically, on the one hand i'm frustrated by how
illogical/destructive organized religion and people's unquestioning
attachments to rituals &amp; traditions <i>can</i> be. on the
other, i think the founders of the major world religions had
extraordinary insight into the human condition, were who they
claimed to be, and, despite what it often seems in the world, that
there's a beautiful underlying framework tying them all together
for anyone who really looks for it. and not just a fluffy
superficial one, actual meaningful interconnections between people
from abraham to joseph smith.<br />
<br />
i had one religious parent and one not, from very different
cultures. i think that led to a healthy process of seeing all the
similarities in both approaches to life.","it really can vary. it could be just staying at home scheming new
ways to outsource more of my life to hungary. maybe out dancing or
at acroyoga or something. or at discussion groups my friends often
host on global affairs and spiritual development. or with roommates
playing board games or cooking some random afghani fusion dish.
generally i have some sort of project or another i'm always working
on that keeps me busy. though i wouldn't consider it below me by
any means to just spend friday night curled up with a good book or
video game.",i have a crush on the xkcd girl?,"i guess if you also feel totally overwhelmed with the myriad things

can't write in my own voice. i don't talk like this, i don't act
like this, but i do write like this. you're stuck with me, your
unreliable narrator; i'll try to be honest but nobody's who they
say they are... and writers are the worst.<br />
<br />
writing's not my job, just a hobby. a computer game company writes
me checks to program for them. the checks seem to shrink the more i
enjoy my job but i'll trade contentment for cash anyday.<br />
<br />
either because of my situation or my disposition, i'm laid back
about big things with short bursts of intensity about little
things. i can spend hours baking and decorating an elaborate
birthday cake but spend less time than that thinking about my
career. i drive driven people crazy.<br />
<br />
which isn't to say i'm a flake or a slacker. towards my
relationships, responsibilities and my hobbies, i'm very committed
but not very openly passionate. i've played ultimate frisbee for
almost half my life, have been programming just as long, and i get
up at 7:30 every morning to practice ""ghetto workouts."" but you
won't find any tattooes or bumper stickers pronouncing my love for
any of these. for me, a certain level of everyday, low level
stick-to-it-ness and consideration says a lot more than
flowers.<br />
<br />
when i'm with someone, it's all about finding new things in
everyday situations, whether it be a different restaurant, a new tv
show or a weird play, exploring our own neighborhood, or just
creative conversation. talking is the constant in my life: i love
talking as an expression of ideas. silly ideas, funny ideas, well
expressed ideas, well thought out ideas, weird ideas -- anything
that makes the normal world seem a little fresher.<br />
<br />
i think accepting random ideas makes me more optimistic. the glass
is always three quarters full to me. as a both sides of the street
are sunny optimist i can see the good and fun side of everything...
except complainers. i hate complainers.<br />

a seafood shack in guillord, connecticut, a rare night away from
campus, sweeping crab and clam shells into a garbage can in the
middle of the table. i don't remember what we talked about, but i
remember laughing. and i recall silence as we secretly took swigs
from beer cans, cozy in brown paper bags, and wondered whether it
would always be like this.<br />
<br />
it wouldn't, of course.<br />
<br />
life became measured in years rather than semesters. it became an
endurance race rather than a sprint. it became mortgages, more
hours in the office and quick meals with friends if lucky, alone if
not.<br />
<br />
everything changed by becoming more the same.<br />
<br />
now, i look for my seafood shack moments in every day moments. i
find laughter in witty snippets of conversation and in the first
words of my nephew. i enjoy the silence of looking at my friends
and family, appreciating them for who they were and all they've
done, rather than wondering what they'll become. the beer's been
replaced with whiskey, but the crab and clams stay the same.","i'm good at making boring tasks interesting through anecdotes,

full of costumes, and heaving bookshelves. i'm a grad school
professor, an itenerant performer, and a fan of both quiet nights
in and going out on the town.<br />
<br />
at 30, i suddenly grew into the singing voice i wish i'd had when i
was trying to get musical theatre roles in my early 20s. i think
i'm fun and playful and kind and thoughtful. i get excited about
weird things - tall ships and maritime history, anatomical
illustration, the london underground. in past incarnations, i have
been a goth dj, a pirate, an aspiring theatre actor/director, and a
tribal belly dancer.<br />
<br />
i love going out to dance to goth, industrial, electropop, 80s, and
balkan music. i play grownup dress-up a lot - one of my favorite
things about the bay area is that there's so many chances to get
your victorian/edwardian/santa/pirate/bride on. to facilitate that
habit, i do a bit of guerilla crafting and sewing (translation: i
have a lot of half-finished projects in bins).<br />
<br />
i enjoy geeking out about wine and food and cocktails, and feel
really lucky to be in one of the best places on earth for such
pastimes.<br />
<br />
i have what might be politely termed ""a strong character."" i'm
passionate about social justice, making the world a better place
for more people, and working on myself in the meantime. i'm pretty
direct.<br />
<br />
i am a contradiction in terms, a sensible hedonist, a compassionate
misanthrope, a thrill-seeker who loves safety and comfort.<br />
<br />
i am intense, curvy, and made out of meat.","i moved to the bay area in 2007 to take a job as a full-time
professor. i guess finishing that dissertation paid off after all!
thanks for the pressure, mom and dad!<br />
<br />
i love what i do: teaching marriage and family therapy. i am
inspired by the social justice aspects of my field, and every week
i get the chance to inspire students with my passion about
relationships and families, understanding how oppression hurts both
of the above, and seeing people as more than just a collection of
diagnoses or symptoms. i get to challenge students to go to
uncomfortable places and learn more about themselves, push them to
be better writers so they can express their ideas effectively, and
encourage them to find out what they're passionate about in our
field so they can go out and facilitate change. i miss actually
doing couple and family therapy, and i'm now licensed in california
so i could see clients if i had time, but teaching is pretty
incredible even though it's often a lot of work for not a lot of
pay. inside i still feel like the student, not the teacher.<br />
<br />
stuff i write and teach about in my field: fat acceptance/health at
every size, working with glbt clients and their relationships,
couple therapy, social justice and therapy, and i'm doing a lot of
thinking about what it means for therapists and other professionals
to try to have a personal life in an era when your private life can
wind up all over the web.<br />
<br />
in my free time, i make the occasional outing on the burlesque
stage, and have worked on overcoming years of control issues by
taking blues dance lessons and going out ballroom dancing now and
then. letting people in is hard. i'm getting better.<br />
<br />
now and then i might go out where there are costumes and waltzing.
generally i seem to be continually on the lookout for new ways to
do ridiculous but fun things in public. preferably with friends
around. also, i've heard they have these things called ""vacations.""
i'm investigating what that's all about. sounds exotic.<br />
<br />
i'm also working on my life-long project of being more honest,
congruent, open-hearted, and compassionate toward myself and
others. it's hard work!","dancing like no one is watching, cooking for my friends, practicing
irrational exuberance, being direct, starting projects but not
finishing them, remembering to be playful, fighting against the
kyriarchy, drinking wine and yelling, inspiring my students to take
over the world, helping couples and families heal, making people
laugh, cuddling my 3 cats, having the greatest friends in the
world.","i'm very animated. i'm usually outgoing and funny. i'm very verbal
- i like banter and conversation, and sometimes i talk fast. you'll
know where i stand on things. i'm very direct, except when i get
embarrassed. i like to accessorize! i have an aesthetic that's
different somehow - if people like me, i'm ""unusual."" if they don't
take to me, ""weird."" i'm a curvy girl, plus-sized, fat, zaftig,
call it what you want but i call it ""size acceptance,"" and i have
""a rack that could bring about world peace"" according to one

some people, but i'm into loving and enjoying the body i'm in. it's
pretty awesome.","i'm bad at these lists.<br />

prejudice. [shakes fist at ok cupid] in spite of their tv-ism, i
shall mention my fondness for buffy, firefly, deadwood, dexter, mad
men, the wire, true blood, and that classic of contemporary bbc
comedy, ""black books."" just now i'm (im)patiently waiting for the
price to drop a bit on season 6 of doctor who. (ok so i finally
watched s6 and... i am really tired of amy pond!) why did i never
watch heroes before now? thanks netflix streaming! you are filling

parton, beats antique, tom waits. suddenly my musical tastes are
running to things that remind me of my grandpa - accordion, banjo,
standup bass. tori amos and i used to be bff but we broke up
somewhere around ""strange little girls."" i hope you're well,
tori.<br />

and how would i live without podcasts of radiolab and this american
life? everything i know about the financial crisis i learned from
ira glass and his minions.<br />

food: lamb, artichokes, asparagus, mushrooms, raspberries, wine of
all kinds, almost any savory/sweet combination like steak with
pomegranate sauce, cheese of all kinds. i usually have an
embarrassing variety of cheese stashed in the fridge. no, i'm
serious. when i moved here from colorado, i had 15 kinds of cheese
to get rid of somehow. i am on a serious spanish tapas kick lately,
and would roll everything in paprika and saffron if i could.<br />

justice, civil rights, intersectionality, why on god's green earth
it's ok to bail out the banks who broke the economy with risky cdos
but not to have single-payer health care. right now i'm also
thinking a lot about how teaching online is destroying my arms and
hands, and how thankful i am for my exercise ball and
anti-inflammatory gel.","at a club dancing my heart out, or having a quiet evening with

papers because i have a deadline. that's maybe not so exciting.","i recently listened to a tal podcast on the financial repercussions

<br />
however, i am open to some charming gentleman butch energy in my
world too - something i've had far too little of.<br />
<br />
you know what would be great?<br />
- someone super smart, scary smart even, who can get all animated
and exciteable about the thing that really gets your brain juices
going<br />
<br />
- someone personable, who can light up a room, plan a shindig,
someone with charisma<br />
<br />
- someone who'd get excited by exploring the physics of shrinky
dinks while making jewelry based on old anatomical drawings in my
kitchen. or wear a jaunty hat and a vintage waistcoat to go out to
dinner or a show. who'd put together a thrifted outfit for dickens
fair, and teach me some drinking songs i don't know yet. a dancer,
an adventurer, a lover of life.<br />
<br />
- someone with goals, a career, and a sense of what they want from
their future and how they're going to get there. i don't need a
person to support me; i have my own career for that! it just seems
like it's better if the person i'm seeing has some understanding of
what that's all about.<br />
<br />
- someone who is a great person to be in relationship with - who
gets how to communicate, how to work at the hard stuff and really
take joy in the wonderful stuff. i'm not a perfect partner and you
don't have to be either.<br />
<br />
- someone who's not scared off by things like social justice,
feminism, queer theory, white privilege... who cares about things i
care about (and has some passions of their own)<br />
<br />
in short, someone who can blend serious with silly, who can spend
the day in a professional world and the night in a club, who is
social and fun, who can match my mixture of introvert and extrovert
(lord knows i like sitting at home watching tv sometimes!), who can
bring hobbies and interests and smarts to the table. someone who
will not be scared off easily. someone with a sense of style.
someone who loves to play, whether it's dress-up or poker or
croquet. someone confident, sassy, knowledgable.<br />

raised). i love exploring and doing wacky things (like pillow
fights or giant nerf gun battles) but i take my school work and
research very seriously. one of my favorite things to do is
adventure around the campus at night and try to find all the little
nooks and crannies that most people ignore, and then look at the
stars and try to figure out which ones are planets, and, if its a
clear night, try to spot a satellite as it crosses the sky. my
schoolwork and shenanigans combined make me a very busy person, but
i always find time for my friends and the people i care
about.<br />
<br />
i often find myself trapped in thought, thinking about some minute
detail about how the world works, and then getting lost in that
thought. i often wish i had someone to share that with.","currently my plans are to finish undergraduate education at
berkeley and then go to graduate school for a phd. from there, i
plan to work in high-tech industry for a while, and then get a mba

love to talk to me about their problems because i'm really good at
listening and really good at hugging.","i'm rather tall. i'm always in a good mood. i have a natural gift
to find the best out of the situation and hold on to that happy
thought, even if the situation is terrible.","i don't have as much time to read as i would like, but i love
dis-topian novels, because they always get me thinking about how a
society could become like that, and how we can prevent that
outcome. my favorite book is probably ""brave new world"" mostly
because in many ways the society is a utopia, but is eerily
disturbing due to the lack of human ambition and progress. i
sometimes wonder how close to that reality we are.<br />
<br />
when i was a little kid i loved star trek, but now i prefer shows
like how i met your mother or big bang theory (i'm trying to get

30066,31,thin,mostly vegan,not at all,never,graduated from masters program,"i've been on west coast most of my life, from southern to central
and now northern california. i also spent a couple years in nyc and
i think it would be difficult to live too far away from the ocean.
i feel like the bay area is probably where i want to stay for a
while. back in santa barbara where i did my undergrad and grad
school, i was involved with a great diy music scene and part of a
wonderful community full of potlucks, shows, bike rides, art and
literary projects. since moving up here, i've found it a bit harder
to meet people, especially since i have a busy job as a teacher.
i'm not into the bar scene, and while i'm starting to learn more
about this place, i still have found it difficult to make
connections. i've always met people through a community, but i
don't think i've met my community here yet.","i teach at an elementary school and that takes up a lot of my time.
i love the teaching part of my job, and working with kids always
keeps life a little more exciting, unpredictable, and enjoyable. in
the past, i've worked at summer camps, done outdoor education, and
worked with kids with special needs at public and private schools.
i put in extra hours at my job, but it's important, and being
connected to the community is something i value a lot. some time in
the future, i plan on changing things up with another grade or
school, or perhaps a completely different kind of educational
setting.","i've been told i'm a pretty good cook and baker. i'm vegan and have
been so for a while. i got my cooking roots learning how to cook
vegetarian in a co-op and in food not bombs. i've lived in several
share house situations with meal plans where i have cooked for
vegans, vegetarians and omnivores. i generally get positive
comments about my food.<br />
<br />
i think i'm also relatively good at my job, which in a way
translates into being good at being patient, persistent, creative,
and reflective.<br />
<br />
i'm also pretty knowledgeable about bicycle maintenance and have a
lot of tools for doing simple and more advanced jobs.<br />
<br />
i've been playing guitar off and on for a number of years, and am
working on making music a more consistent priority in my life. i
wouldn't say i'm really good at it, but i enjoy it a lot.","if i'm with my brother, they first notice i'm an identical twin. as
to my personality, people probably notice that i am pretty mellow
and relatively quiet, that i'm an optimist, idealist, and realist
all rolled up into one, that i like to think and be challenged,
that at times i am a little indecisive, and that i revel in finding
joy in diy creativity and the arts.","books: since i'm often reading books related to my job, the
majority of my reading lately has actually been children's and
young adult literature. as to adult books, i'm currently reading
george r. r. martin, i'm sometimes drawn to nonfiction about
history or science, and ray bradbury is probably my favorite
author. dandelion wine is required reading for the summer time at
some point in everyone's life. i also enjoy graphic novels, small
press comics, and zines.<br />
<br />
movies: i enjoy a wide variety of movies and can find things to
appreciate in both the good and the bad ones. i'm a bit of a sucker
for fantasy and sci-fi epics, i like documentaries, i get swept
away with good cinematography in westerns, i find fun in alien and
zombie attacks, and i'm always up for childhood favorites. i also
enjoy seeing older films, and midnight for maniacs at the castro. i
watch tv shows but never with commercials, i recently thoroughly
enjoyed game of thrones and think freaks and geeks , the wonder
years, deadwood and the wire might be my all time television
favorites.<br />
<br />
music: i have pretty eclectic interests, but i guess i would say i
listen predominately to indie and diy punk, post punk, hard core,
and a little less so to old time, country blues, alan lomax stuff,
and jazz . if i look on my itunes, some of the most played in the
past year include masshysteri, daniel striped tiger, andrew jackson
jihad, tom waits, nana grizol, rural alberta advantage, defiance
ohio, breathe owl breathe, rvivr, good luck, beirut, she &amp; him,
two hand fools, jolie holland, old against me, doc watson, bob
dylan, please inform the captain, the carter family, titus
andronicus, former members of alfonsin, and black heart procession.
i like going to shows, but usually find myself having a much better
time at an all ages or house show than a bar.<br />
<br />
food: i like to eat a wide variety of food and cook at home most
weekdays, but i really enjoy going out to eat a couple times a
week. some of the restaurants i have liked in the bay area include
cha-ya,, burma superstar, green papaya, lanesplitter, fellini,
udupi palace, souley vegan, zante's, big lantern, papalote, and
taqueria cancun. i like cooking waffles for weekend brunches, bagel
sandwich picnics in the summer time, and all manner of themed
potlucks.","words, music, cooking with others, bikes, summer sun, and chilly
winter nights.","composition: how things like words, images, music, the environment,

are my vocation (programming computers) and my avocation (<a class=
""ilink"" href=""/interests?i=ballroom+dancing"">ballroom dancing</a>).
i've been a competitive amateur ballroom dancer for 12 years now.
i'm serious about it, but not to the exclusion of doing other
things with my spare time.<br />
<br />
i'm self-confident, but not in the way most people mean. i'm not
the bold, brassy, executive type. but i am confident in myself, my
abilities, and my knowledge about my likes and dislikes.<br />
<br />
i am bright, loyal, and contented","right now i'm passionate about two things -- my job and my dancing.
i work as a software developer and although i care a lot about the
projects i work on, i learned the hard way that there is more to
life than 70 hour work weeks. it's rare for me to actually be in
the office more than 50 hours a week. i do spend lots of time
outside of work (in the shower, driving, etc.) thinking about
problems from the office.",,,"i read a lot of books. my recent favorites are ""the last lecture"",
""the physics of the impossible"", ""confessions of an economic hit
man"", and ""off armaggedon reef"". so everything from hard core
science to science fiction; geo-politics to heart-wrenching
biographies.<br />
<br />
as far as food goes, i like just about everything. i feel really
fortunate to live in san francisco where there such great
opportunities for great food. my favorite restaurant in san
francisco is the farallon, partly for the food, partly for the
decor -- but i save that for special occassions. i'm a good enough
cook to cook for myself -- but i don't really have the knack for
cooking that i know some people have.","food, water, shelter, ...<br />

<br />
easy decisions: putting on music over putting on the television
(exceptions: mad men and 30 rock). sleeping on a bed over sleeping
on the ground. touching over needing space. talking over needing
quiet. the graduate over the godfather. a few well-designed things
over lots of random stuff. dark, forever, over milk. wine over
beer, red over white. interesting over popular. the city over the
wilderness and the ocean over the mountains. sfmoma over at&amp;t
park. the greek over the coliseum. fresh squeezed over from
concentrate. following curiosity over just following. affection
over restraint. and, never giving up over settling.<br />
<br />
really important things: i want to be the first person you turn to
when the news is great, the first one you turn to when it isn't and
just the first one you turn to, period. and, likewise, i want you
to turn to. i want to be able to laugh our asses off, then work
through something emotional, then debate something philosophical
and then circle back to laughing. all while brushing our teeth. i
want to know that we are fully in each other's corners, come hell
or the highest water. i want you to know and love and enjoy my kids
(one of each, 18 and 16), because they are funny and really worth
knowing. if you have kids, i want to show you how happy i am being
a dad. i want to share a love of words and the desire to use them
well. i want trust, warmth, generosity of heart and a keen sense of
irony, and promise to give the same in return. i want to build a
world together and make it be exactly how we want it to be.<br />
<br />
good small things: my car sitting in the garage while i take bart
into sf for work. very large bowls of cereal (weekdays) or oatmeal
(weekends). almonds. the smell of eucalyptus. the sound of the
ocean. both, simultaneously (went to school in santa barbara). a
satisfying ride on my road bike. a well-crafted subject line. my
great grandmother's cupcake recipe. photographs.<br />
<br />
a few beliefs: kissing is entirely underrated and highly
predictive. serial commas are lame. if you are interested in
someone, you should show it in words. good ones. movies, on the
whole, should be substantially better; it's getting pretty
embarrassing. apple should make a car.<br />
<br />
some concerns: that sagging and uggs will never go away. that the
bay bridge will never be finished. that design within reach really
isn't. that sometimes a triple latte doesn't quite do it. that the
needle (you?) is small and the haystack is really, really
big.<br />
<br />
random confessions: if the sipping hole lines up with the seam on
my latte cup, i have to move it. i need to eat chocolate every day.
i get short-term hooked on songs and play them way too much
(current: ""neighborhood #4/7 kettles"" from arcade fire's funeral).
until i joined okc, i had no idea there were so many bisexuals. i
love my sonicare.<br />
<br />
parting thought: i hope that we all find the one we are looking
for.","drinking in the time i have with my kids. working with whip smart
and talented people. taking pictures. following my curiosity.
trying to be a solid friend. fending off impatience with the
process of finding her/you.",i'd rather that you tell me.,hopefully nothing embarrassing.,"current: toggling between how we are hungry by dave eggers and the
steve jobs bio. recents: catcher in the rye (reread), freedom by
jonathan franzen and bossypants by tina fey. yep, i jump around a

i have been a fan of dave eggers for years, as an author and as a
johnny appleseed of literacy; his 826 valencia is inspiring.
visited 826 chicago (called the boring store) last summer and it's
(of course) fantastic.<br />
<br />
a few movies i've loved (in no particular order): the
graduate,<br />
napoleon dynamite, little miss sunshine, garden state, my life as a
dog, lost in translation, rain man, eternal sunshine of the<br />
spotless mind, american beauty, the royal tenenbaums.<br />
<br />
music: long-running favorites: arcade fire, the shins and death
cab. also love the xx, deerhunter, zero 7, cut copy, fleet foxes
and (yes, they're back) coldplay. dean martin singing ""let it snow""
makes the holidays (love christmas music). and, it is hard to
resist dipping into the 80's once in a while.<br />
<br />
food: boot &amp; shoe service, le colonial, plouf, tartine,
anchor<br />
&amp; hope. next: commonwealth, flour + water, frances, plum,<br />

finished reading the hunger games trilogy so that i could watch the

do not proceed one paragraph further unless you wish to know the
unknown, and find out more about yourself sexually.<br />
<br />
i see you.<br />
<br />
allow me to make this very simple.<br />
i am a sexually dominant alpha male, whose spiritual work in life
is to seek out submissive or submission-curious females, and to
envelope them with my emotional warmth, spank them, tie them up,
hold down, and completely have my way with them including all sorts
of pornographic activities that most women only dream about. then
to daddy, train, love, and hold them.<br />
if this is making you blush a little, then you are in the right
place.<br />
i am a human door, a portal, a spiritual diving bell, a chaperon to
the darker you that lives in your hidden world.<br />
i am a shadow guide.<br />
<br />
about that thing........<br />
<br />
the thing you carry inside you, that coal on fire, that immense
weight, the longing, that which you hide from all, behind the ""good
girl"" and proper manners veil, that thing that crushes you, and
squeezes the breath from your body, and tears from your chest, that
thing, i know and love.<br />
i know you have it in you. i know it haunts you. and distracts you,
and that you want to now it well, yet you are a stranger to it, and
therefore to yourself.<br />
<br />
the days pass, and you spend some time in thought and fantasy, of
another place, another time where a man with no hesitation, a man
with full command, takes you, strips you, and reveals you, and
crushes the facade, and then drinks in your surrendered beauty,
enjoying himself at will, over the altar of your body.<br />
<br />
i know that there are a lot of things that a lady or girl would let
go of, if only she could find a person who knew what to do with
them.<br />
<br />
that would be me. you called. i heard you. here i am.<br />
<br />
i have a big non-bdsm life, travel often and, am involved in a
number of creative projects.<br />
here, i am single minded in my interest in ladies, who need to
submit sexually, and possibly for the first time. i am a portal
guardian, and probably the safest place for a new submissive, or
submission-curious woman to let go.<br />
<br />
my personal folklore:<br />
<br />
- i am very picky.<br />
- sex is always involved<br />
- i am very, very experienced<br />
- i am not looking for anything long term. i am that place where
you leave your emotional luggage once or thrice, and fly off.<br />
- i know exactly what i am doing<br />
- i am not for the wishy washy nor the timid.<br />
- i am safe, sane, and sympathetic, and respect all boundaries and
limits and never work without safewords.<br />
- i am 100% daddy and dominant<br />
- i am older (51)<br />
- i am highly (self) educated, worldly and know myself.<br />
- i am exceedingly comfortable around women of all ages<br />
- this is a spiritual inclination first, and a physical one
secondly<br />
- i admire grace, form, poise, and actual heartfelt emotion over
clothing, physical type, ""scene"", self-identification, or any
political or religious persuasions or practices.<br />
- i am lover of the little girl who lives in a grown woman's
body<br />
- i adore tears, trembling, sighs, and moans, and work that
emotional end of the spectrum. i have been called ""the rainmaker"",
for my ability to make women cry through conversational and
emotional means alone.<br />
spanking, cropping, handcuffs, hot wax, caning, dressing up
scenarios, filthy language, and rough sex are my alpha.<br />
simply nudity, soft talk, spiritual energy movement, breath
control, holding, and tenderness are my omega.<br />
- i am an ordinary looking man with a few extra pounds.<br />
- i am an author<br />
- i am still undecided about sf, because the weather is so
unpredictable here. (i am from a nearby place)<br />
- i am astonishingly intuitive, and gentle, giving what i am, which
is a living human arrow.<br />
- i make hardcore pornography, except there are no cameras, no
film, no pictures, and no recording of any kind involved. however
it is still super hardcore porn, for my memories alone.<br />
<br />
- i am curious about you.<br />
<br />
sometimes i walk around this city, and can feel the unanswered
questions on the air, and feel the electric weight of expectations
all around me. i am a lightening rod for emotional discourse. i am
also a consensual predator who will not approach you without an
invitation.<br />
<br />
if you are a lady between 18-45, healthy mentally and physically,
and not a hardcore republican, you are invited to contact me, for
conversation and whatever fate has in store for us both.<br />

self.<br />
<br />
where to begin (i sort of feel like this is an admissions
application personal statement, anyone else? )..<br />
originally from a suburb of boston, i've lived in california for 7
years and really love it here. i love the diversity and the unique
opportunities that present themselves!<br />
i have my masters in social work (and slowly working towards a
license) and feel really lucky to be in a career that i love. i
work with adults living in the tenderloin in supportive housing.
while the work is intense, i can laugh at anything and not take
anything too seriously!<br />

savor:<br />
i have a deep love for my fleece socks.<br />
i'm currently listening to the new florence and the machine and
coldplay on repeat...and if i find a song i really like, i can play
it on repeat to death.<br />
i'm not very tech savvy. i still have my free phone you get when
you sign up with the telephone company. i don't own an ipod or a
digital camera, but i do have my original mp3 player from 2004
that's the size of a brick (update: stolen! what could the resale
value really be on that?) and a 35mm camera that i love. but
sometimes on bart, what i wouldn't give for a good game of
tetras.<br />
i like conversations that don't have much purpose, but i'm good at
having purposeful conversations.<br />
i dream about what it would be like to buy a house here and
completely renovate it with reclaimed items.<br />
i'm a pretty tidy person. i never judge anyone else's level of
cleanliness/tidiness, but i am on the neat side. i may alphabetize
your books by author. (not)<br />
i like to have a fan on when i'm sleeping. the sound is really
soothing to me.<br />
i like to travel with purpose. i tend to take a lot of volunteer
oriented trips to far away places. i think it's a great way to
discover and really delve into a culture. some trips have included
working on a bird reserve in israel, teaching english at an
orphanage in india, and bathing elephants in thailand.<br />
i'm not much of a foodie person and can't cook. sad, but true. i
don't spend much time in the kitchen, but am always amazed by those
who put so much love and attention into their meals.<br />

also got a pretty strong sense of dedication to my friends, work

absolute blast. in addition, i'm trying my hand at coaching our
school's softball team but it's a lot of work even as an assistant
coach.<br />
<br />
to be honest, school takes up most of my time. even when i'm not
there it feels like the grading and planning never let up. even
with school taking up so much of my time, i know it will get easier
as i keep going and i can see myself doing this for a long time to
come. in the mean time, i'm trying to get back into yoga and maybe
take up painting, we'll see.","i enjoy making a mess in the kitchen, especially when tasty things

know anyone there.<br />

movies:<br />
despite what netflix suggests i would be interested in, i like good
movies. doesn't need to be any particular genera although i do
enjoy action thrillers with interesting plots (bourne trilogy!).
funny though, i rarely have seen the movies that are usually up for
oscars. maybe netflix was right about me...<br />
<br />
shows:<br />
not sure how to describe this other than through examples. scrubs,
house, modern family, the league, dexter, battlestar galactica,
lost (but only seasons 1-4), the daily show. just started watching
how i met your mother (verdict is good so far)<br />
<br />
music:<br />
all depends on my mood. rock and classic rock are usually a pretty
good bet but i can pretty much get down with anyone from
""classical"" to hip-hop. sorry, leave the country on the shelf. i'm
also like listening to several podcasts, especially during long

feel differently about from day to day is to say too much and hope
that something resonates in the heart of the right person:<br />
<br />
i am a sweet, sensual, sensitive, powerful, funny, intelligent,
self-aware, willing to be vulnerable, heartfelt, and imperfect
woman. i'm seeking to meet men who are creative, sincere, loving,
active, courageous, self-aware, and strong.<br />
<br />
i guide yoga backpacking trips, i'm also completing an
apprenticeship to guide vision quests, and mentoring a girl's
coming-of-age group (i call this professionally annoying 13-14 year
old girls, which turns out to be just as easy now as it was when i
was 13-14).<br />
<br />
i love backpacking, the sierras, the mountains, the ocean, the
country. i love little antique-y things, lace, singing, my singing
lessons and my singing teacher, furniture made of wood, hearts,
birds, and flowers. i love having flowers around, inside and out. i
like to call people darlin', honey, sweetie-pie, babe...<br />
<br />
i like to laugh, make fun of myself and my life, i'm sarcastic but
not in a mean way<br />
<br />
i garden a little and love how it feels to go outside and pick
greens for breakfast. i want to start living my country life here,
making more kraut and planting more food...<br />
<br />
i do want to learn how to make more things...<br />
<br />
i want good things for everyone, simply. tangibly that means i
expect of myself and others a baseline of respect, honesty, and
thoughtfulness, <em>especially</em> in delicate or challenging
situations. all will be forgiven, but we can challenge ourselves to
be present and better people when it's a rough day.<br />
<br />
good scotch and tequila are for sipping, and i like to have a drink
on occasion<br />
<br />
i like running. i like getting in cold water in the sierras in the
summer, takes the heat and pain out of body sore from carrying a
pack over 13,000 foot passes.<br />
<br />
i live my life with gratitude and humility.<br />
<br />
<strong>you are:</strong><br />
funny, loving, light and deep, irreverent and sincere, sweet and
sturdy. intentional about the kind of relationship you want to
create but know that you want relationship. you're looking to open
and deepen, you're willing and even happy to be challenged and
offer the same. you can receive love, respect, admiration and
occasionally sexy texts.<br />
<br />
nature, the wilderness, or by other names, is important and i want
to share it. camping and having tea on the back of the truck
watching the sun go down.<br />
<br />
i like men who are fun(ny), good communicators, who are gentle and
strong, who have their own sense of what is right and wrong- but
who don't need to be right all the time...<br />
<br />
i also appreciate (though certainly don't expect) men who touch my
waist or back, who open doors, who offer to buy things but let me
reciprocate. this is a little controversial so again it's not
something i need, i took feminist theory in college too. i also
have a southern grandpa and am comfortable recieveing love in those
forms if you like to show it in that way. just be yourself :)<br />
<br />
<strong>things that seem important to relationship:</strong><br />
i find the best thing for me these days, if possible and
appropriate, is to dance it out hike it out shake it out laugh it
out cry it out touch it out hug it out kiss it out and get out of
my head. it's been so awesome to learn how to use my body as a tool
for expressing and moving energy. i think i'm looking for someone
who'll balance me out when i get to heady, who'll be able to snap
me out of it if i'm going down the rabbit hole to over-processing
land...<br />
<br />
i heard someone, a teacher of mine, say that to be in relationship
one has to be willing to get hurt and willing to hurt another, not
because we want to, but because this is inevitable in relationship.
maybe not those exact words, but that idea. i think that's true,
and really important, so it becomes less threatening and we can
develop tools for dealing with it instead of getting stuck with
blame and victim-hood.<br />
<br />
chemistry and physical attraction are incredibly important to me...
in some ways primary. i've started to think of physical intimacy as
being the core way of being together in relationship. i noticed
that when there's been a rough spot in past relationships that we
both could let it go more easily as we moved instead into the dance
of seducing each other. of course i love to share other things too,
but i think men and women who love each other and really lean on
their physical connection to move through experiences forgive more
easily, love more fully, and share an amazing connection. it takes
courage and spicyness to face a woman's emotions, i know it and
will appreciate it :)<br />
<br />
i want us each to maintain the friendships, lives, passions,
interests, and dreams that we love individually, even if they
aren't shared. sharing certain dreams or visions for the future is
also important. i don't want to live in the city for the rest of my
life. i like the wildness that emerges in me when i live and spend
time in non-man-made environments, aka ecosystems. feeling and
breathing trees, birds, wind, clouds, water... i want that.<br />
<br />
i want to support you in pursuing your purpose and your passions,
even if that means a little less time with me. i really enjoy the
integrity you can feel with men who know what they're here to do
and are doing it.<br />
<br />
i'm interested in learning more about david deida and third stage
relationships. i'm interested in ways of engaging with men that are
liberating and enlivening for both of us :)<br />
<br />
i have friends and community and think it's really important to not
depend so singly on a partner to fill all our needs. so talking
about <em>everything</em> doesn't need to be at the core of our
relationship, and yet being comfortable and fluent at processing
seems important...","i help adults reconnect to themselves, heal, transition, transform,
grow, learn, connect with spirit, connect with the earth, and/or
other things by guiding them through experiences in nature. i also
mentor middle-school girls, write, live in an awesome house with
really good friends and exercise (running and climbing).","loving people :)<br />
<br />
also, cooking, having fun, cuddling and kissing, noticing the
lovely details, communication, making ungodly amounts of tea!,
playing with ""problems"", arranging flowers, thinking in systems,
being spontaneous, wilderness guiding, crying my heart out and then
laughing my head off, feeling it all and knowing that i'm fine, and
writing.<br />
<br />
i love to create and build things from scratch, like book shelves
and curtains or pillows. but i have few woodworking skills and very
few tools around these days. i would love to have more lessons in
building :)<br />
<br />
i stole this next part from someone else's profile:<br />
i am really terrible at: being in hot weather without getting way
irritable and incapable of doing much or thinking clearly,
finishing books, being around other people playing frisbee and not
getting hit in the head, sports that involve catching things while
running, keeping a regular climbing or gym schedule, and other
things that you will undoubtedly discover that i'm currently
unaware of or forgot.","i don't know, i suppose there's a lot that people wouldn't tell you
straight out that they've noticed about you! maybe that i'm short,
or that my eyes are slightly different shades of blue? i'm intense
and sincere, i will tell you what i think truthfully if you ask, i
also make people feel comfortable because i love everybody and want
them to feel like they can be themselves :)",this question overwhelms me and i can't deal with it...,"hot tea with milk and honey and a book, family and friends, bobby
pins, pretty lacy vintage slips, 15 degree sleeping bag for high
sierra summers, my journal and a pen.<br />
<br />
my practical answer: water, knife, light weight puffy jacket, you
my love, sun protection, and a map","throughout the year the answer to this changes, but right now i'm
thinking a lot about helping my business grow and sustain itself,
and how to put yoga backpacking trips in front of the right
audiences...<br />
<br />
i dream about building permaculture villages on lots of land and
re-wilding my life","out of town, dinner party, a drink with a friend, some obligation,
but mostly, out of town :)","after a lot of traveling and fluctuation i'm feeling ready for a
relationship. i don't want to jump in, i want to know a person
before committing to anything- but even this open and tentative
approach to intimacy doesn't seem that easy in the bay area. it
feels like everyone wants to experience love and keep all their
options open.<br />
<br />
i was raised to understand that commitment creates it's own
opportunities, like depth, and a strong context for physical
exploration, vulnerability, growth and being oneself. so i'm
looking (eventually, and in it's own time) for a best friend and
lover to share everything beautiful, fun, difficult, and dark with.
someone to share all the things i'm grateful for with, someone to
play with, to learn from and to teach, etc.<br />
<br />
so, respectfully, i request that you check in with yourself and be
clear that you want commitment with the right person and that you
are actually ready for it. i'm also not philosophically opposed to
exploring other relationship styles and forms if they feel right,
but i feel pretty inexperienced in that area and feel pretty clear
that it's not what i want right now.<br />
<br />
also, i have slowly become a very spiritual person. i'm not
religious, or super woo woo, but i am a little woo woo. i still
love science and physics and the brilliance of the material world.
i also love people who make magic happen and the mystery of the
unseen world. please feel free to ask me questions about this! i'm
not in a coven and i don't plan my life around astrology...per se

wussy things that aren't that private at all, you probably won't
interest me. come on, say you have herpes or have a foot fetish or
are an ex-con or something. you want me to model it for you? here
are some private things: i was date raped in high school, i used to
be bulimic, my second toes are really long on my feet, i've been a
sex worker, i orgasm pretty easily. i could go on...you should too.","read the 'don't message me if' part below. there is a huge chance
you fit into it!<br />
<br />
i'm actually going to borrow half of my girlfriend's profile here,
as we are so similar and she is spot on.<br />
<br />
read every single word here you lazy readers!!!<br />
<br />
only people who tell the truth need apply. people who tell the
truth sometimes or only when it won't cause them problems: you are
not for me. this includes the ""lying to protect/not hurt""
bullshit.<br />
in this vein, it's a real turn off those of you who are ashamed to
be on ok cupid and therefore don't say where you work. i'm thinking
especially of all the screenwriters and other hollywood types who
won't say what they write for. not sexy to me. i'm about
sex-positivity and being loud and proud about everything in your
life, in all forums, in all situations. if you're not, you won't be
sexy to me.<br />
<br />
i am looking for 1)actual partners (2) hot lovers (3) political
allies<br />
read my whole damn profile!!! (i will know if you don't, and not
write you back).<br />
lesbians: i'm not a straight person posing as bi to be hotter: come
at me.<br />
<br />
preference given to: artists (not as hobby) , scholars, sex
workers, foreigners (especially w place to stay outside usa, and
especially italians), dancers, men who wear tight clothing,
revolutionaries, poly people, bisexual men and women, and very very
smart people.<br />
if you are ridiculously honest you're halfway there.<br />
bisexual men: yes please! i want threesomes with two bi men who
play with each other!! a lot!!!!<br />
<br />
look at my photos: be realistic about if we're a match. and look
like your photos! (i do.) come on, do you think that will work?! at
least send me an accurate photo if you're going to insist on lying
in your profile photos.<br />
i'm serious, you think i'm hot and sexy? you need to be too!!! no
wishful thinking 'maybe she likes overweight/average looking
people. i don't.<br />
<br />
dont message me if: your profile calls women chicks or girls; you
believe in capitalism; you are monogamous and bigoted agains poly
people; you believe in god, the secret, astrology, or any other
superstition; you like cops or cop shows; you have way more tv or
film than books on your favorites list or you don't read much at
all; you wear loose bagging clothing, say lol, and think america is
a 'free country'; you are sexist or bigoted against sex workers;
you say safe things only, you need to establish 'trust' before you
reveal anything or talk honestly; you like the u.s. military, you
think drugs should be illegal.<br />
and don't message me if your profile is an ironic cynical joke that
says nothing sincere. getting sick of those. if these guys write
something clever (but never visionary or brilliant) about what
they're doing with their life instead of saying their job straight
up. you won't get a reply.<br />
<br />
i will not reply if you write: how's it going, how's your week, i
like your profile you seem chill want to hang, etc. get the point?
write something interesting or don't write.<br />
i'm serious, you have to distinguish yourself from the others. try
not talking like an american. or not being one...<br />
<br />
if you want to be my boyfriend or girlfriend you must be<br />
be fearless, eccentric, one of a kind, intellectual, artistic,
sexy, ridiculously honest, revolutionary (not just 'liberal""). i
know you think women want a 'down to earth, laid back, respectful,
normal guy'. well i don't. i want freaks and eccentrics and
reckless ridiculous originals. if you like the transformers movie
it's hopeless.<br />
<br />
your profile shouldn't read like you're trying not to scare women
or men away. it should scare a lot of people away. it should be
controversial. you should flaunt it at work and everywhere else. i
want tyler durden, jim morrison, george jackson, che guevara,
dennis rodman, andy kaufmann, tupac...get it?<br />
<br />
it should go without saying you must be comfortable with my
partners. seriously, don't expect to have any sort of relationship
with me that goes beyond one night if your'e uncomfortable meeting
my partners. don't worry, they're not jealous. they would love to
watch us together, in fact!<br />
<br />
please be clear about what you want: if you want a one night stand,
don't waste my time in some long seduction game as if we're going
to be best buddies. if you want long-term, say it up front and
realize you'll have to be 10 times as interesting and 100 times
more similar to me than the casual sex partners.<br />
i would much prefer consistent lovers/friends to one night stands,
but i'll consider the latter if you're really hot and not
boring.<br />
<br />
if you think the political can't be separated from the personal you
have way more of a chance. bourgeois people don't interest me.
engage the fight. this means you all the people who hide everything
personal away here because being open and political isnt important
to you.<br />
<br />
men: i am open to all races but i prefer black men and middle
easternish skin. i also strongly prefer foreigners. french speakers
to the head of the line! bonus if you have drugs to give me or a
horse for me to ride. i like big penises but it's not
necessary.<br />
<br />
i'm new to berkeley and it's lonely being a radical in america so
any other radical feminists, prison abolitionists, communists,
gadflys, experimenters, come at me even for friendship and
solidarity.<br />
also looking for people to make beats for my raps.<br />
if you interest me, i will reply. if not, i wont. dont' write
twice. most of you will not get a reply. not trying to be mean,
it's just that i have so little time and can't respond to everyone.
i'd also rather kill two birds with one stone and meet you at an
event or something else i'm doing.",white,68.0,-1,artistic / musical / writer,2012-05-24-00-46,"berkeley, california",,bisexual,,atheism and very serious about it,f,,no,"english (fluently), french (okay)",available

life and looking for new people and experiences (stunt driving and

that i was ""supposed"" to do in life. while i did find a tiny pot of
gold, i know there must be more to it and it would be great to find
a partner to share it all with. so now, i'm saying f-it to the map

engineer, travelling around the world building cell phone networks,
bringing phones to 2nd/3rd world countries. then i burned out after
6 years of that and decided i needed a change of pace.<br />
<br />
i hit the reset button and started a film production company with a
couple friends. we made a few indie films (one available on itunes,
1 on netflix, and a few that probably should not see the light of
day), some music videos, tv commercials, and short films for big
corporations. this lasted for a few really fulfilling, fun and
scrappy years.<br />
<br />
then i hit the reset button again (it gets easier and more
satisfying every time). now i fight trolls (not the kind with the
big eyes and crazy hair) i love my job and get to learn something
new everyday. it's pretty freakin awesome and most days i can't
believe how lucky i am. i still produce film projects on the side
