    "1. Use Logistic regression to detect genuine vs nongenuine bank notes. How does it perform in and out of sample?\n",

    "1. If you try to fit and test on the entire dataset, you might get a 100% score.\n",
    "2. Try using cross validation to see the performance out of sample\n",
    "3. If this still confuses you, don't use all the features and/or try using a linear kernel.\n",
    "4. Try plotting scatters of the features to see why (i.e. maybe there's already a linear hyperplane we can use without needing to use kernels). The scatters might shed light onto why a linear kernel might have a harder time."
